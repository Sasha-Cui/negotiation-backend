Are you looking to wrap this quickly, or just testing the waters?"", ""Round 3.1 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Sorry, but I was honest, I'm not in a rush on selling and I need to cover lingering mortgage costs and fees.

Those 600k comps you\u2019re citing are the top end and typically turnkey; yours still needs spend.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a real 600k buyer today, you should chase it.

On an older Main Street structure, that\u2019s easily a six\u2011figure spend before I can open the doors, plus downtime risk.

What\u2019s got you considering it, and how quickly are you hoping to wrap something up?\n\nFrom my end, rents are soft with lobster prices where they are, and that building will want some capital to keep it running cleanly. I\u2019m not buying this as a rental play, so I\u2019ve got to be disciplined on price. If we keep it simple\u2014as\u2011is, no drama, quick close\u2014I\u2019m at 495,000.

And 495 might be a place to start talking, but you know as well as I do this isn\u2019t just any old triplex.

But the \u201csix hundreds and up\u201d comps you\u2019re thinking of are cleaner rentals with fewer upgrades needed. For what I\u2019d do with it, I\u2019m looking at fire separations, accessibility, electrical, and a fair bit of interior work.

I appreciate that you came up, but 525 is too low than expected. You\u2019re buying one of the last mixed-use pieces on Main Street with history, frontage, and flexibility you cannot reproduce.

The lobster downturn has Main Street slower, and older mixed\u2011use always carries leasing/turnover and systems risk that comps of cleaned\u2011up 600k triplexes don\u2019t reflect.\n\nIf there\u2019s a deal, it lives in the low/mid\u20115s. If you can get to 565k (or better), I can stretch and we can ink this week. Otherwise, I\u2019ll likely peel off to Starrs Road\u2014simpler land, no mixed\u2011use complications.\n\nIs 580 truly your floor, or can you meet me at 565? I\u2019ll keep my 510k on the table for 72 hours while you think it over."", ""Round 3.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Can you talk to me more about the winter risk you see? I understand some hesitancy over mixed use. However, it also doesn't look like you've maintained the property behind and I am curious because you have not answered my uestion regarding the intent for the property. But I think there is a deal to be made here. I would just like to know"", ""Round 4.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Fair questions.\n\nOn winter risk: from November through April, if a unit turns, you can easily sit 6\u201310 weeks before a decent tenant shows. Meanwhile you\u2019re carrying heat/electric (or risking freeze-ups), snow, insurance, and any storefront lights just to keep it presentable. Mixed-use storefronts take the brunt when lobster prices are off\u2014foot traffic and retail hours pull back, so that street-level income is the softest in winter. Buyers price that downtime and carrying cost in, especially on an older mixed-use.\n\nOn intent: I\u2019m expanding my office footprint\u2014offices, conference rooms, client space. I\u2019m not trying to be a landlord here long-term. I\u2019m not asking you to underwrite any buildout; that\u2019s on me. But the conversion/tenant-transition risk and mixed-use friction are real, and I have to price them. As for the place behind, it\u2019s safe and insured; we haven\u2019t \u201cactivated\u201d it because I\u2019ve been evaluating my options, not running it as a rental.\n\nYour 580 is above what this winter market supports for an older mixed-use. Here\u2019s my next step to keep this moving:\n\n525,000, all cash, as\u2011is, 14\u2011day close, 5 business\u2011day confirmatory inspection limited to major structural/title only. Proof of funds ready now. This stands 48 hours.\n\nIf you can bring me a concrete counter under 560,000\u2014ideally somewhere in the 540s\u2014we can probably wrap this up this week. If not, I\u2019ll likely pivot to Starrs Road where the land is simpler. Your move."", ""Round 4.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Thank you for sharing, I really appreciate it.

I\u2019ve walked 123 Main: good bones, but the units feel dated, there\u2019s some deferred maintenance, and with rents flat in town and the market a bit soft lately, it pencils for me as a straight rental in the mid-500s.

I appreciate your candid feedback.\n\nThat said, I do want to clarify the value perspective from my side. While I agree the units are not newly renovated, 123 Main benefits from mixed-use zoning, a long income-producing history, and strong future flexibility that goes beyond a straight residential rental. Recent comparable sales continue to support a value range closer to the mid-to-high $500s, even in today\u2019s softer market.\n\nAs you noted, the market may be a bit soft at the moment, but this is a cyclical town and I am in no financial pressure to sell. I am only considering a sale if the pricing truly reflects the long-term value of the asset.\n\nWith that in mind, the number I would need to be at to proceed is $600,000. At that level, I would be comfortable moving forward in a clean and straightforward transaction. Anything materially below that, I would prefer to simply continue holding the property.\n\nTo answer your questions briefly:\n\u2013 I am selling as part of a broader retirement simplification, not due to urgency.\n\u2013 I have had informal interest through local channels, but nothing firm at this stage.\n\u2013 And as mentioned, my price expectation is $600,000.\n\nIf that range works for you, I\u2019m happy to continue the conversation.

On an income basis I\u2019m in the high-400s/low-500s.\n\nI can make a small move to 485,000\u2014clean and straightforward.\n\nWhen you say \u201cmaterially below\u201d 600, what does that mean to you? Are you actually open to a number with a 5 in front, and if so, how far into the 5s? If you can bring it decisively into the 5s, I can lean a bit further. If 600 is a hard line, I\u2019ll likely step aside and let you hold.\n\nAre you comfortable holding for another year if that\u2019s what it takes, or is there a window you\u2019d prefer to hit?"", ""Round 3.1 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): I appreciate the clarity on your side, and I understand your underwriting on today\u2019s rents and required updates.\n\nTo answer your question directly \u2014 yes, I am open to a number in the 5s. However, for me it would need to be at $550,000 to make sense to proceed. That would already reflect a meaningful adjustment from what I believe the long-term market value of the property supports, taking into account the mixed-use zoning, location, and future upside.\n\nAt anything below $550, I would rather continue holding the property. I\u2019m in a position where I\u2019m completely comfortable waiting another year or longer if needed \u2014 there is no timing pressure on my end.

At $505,000, the number simply does not justify letting this asset go for me. Between the mixed-use zoning, long-term optionality, and the location itself, I would be far more comfortable continuing to hold the property than sell at that level \u2014 even factoring in carry and market timing.\n\nTo answer your question directly: the lowest number that would allow me to feel I did not leave money on the table is $520,000. That is truly where I can land. It reflects a meaningful concession from my original $550 position, but it is also the point where selling versus holding becomes truly rational for me.\n\nIf $520,000 works on your side, I\u2019m fully aligned with moving quickly \u2014 clean structure, as-is, no delays.

I\u2019ve walked 123 Main and I\u2019m interested, but only at the right number. With the rental comps where they are, the softer local economy\u2014lobster prices aren\u2019t helping\u2014and the likely capex on a building of this vintage, my price is $495,000.\n\nIs that in the realm of what you\u2019d consider? Are you up against any timing or other pressures on your end, or is this purely about hitting a number? And where were you hoping to land on price?"", ""Round 1.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Hi there, thanks for your interest in the building, but the current offering price is too low. Would you like to provide a little more detail, like what's the use of this property? Would it be commercial use ot residential use? There are recent comparable sales that peg the property's value at $600,000. Moreover, this is already a very efficient price since, as you know, the price of lobster is down for now. However, Yarmouth is a lobster fishing town, and it will bounce back."", ""Round 2.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I\u2019m looking at 123 Main for a commercial build-out\u2014offices with some client-facing space\u2014not as a long-term rental hold. That means I\u2019m staring at code and conversion costs (life-safety, accessibility/egress, fire separation, commercial washrooms), plus the usual vintage-building capex. The comps at 600 sound like turnkey residential triples; this isn\u2019t that apples-to-apples.\n\nGiven rates, insurance, and the softer rent picture, 600k doesn\u2019t pencil. I can move a bit from my first pass and make it $515,000.\n\nLevel with me\u2014what\u2019s driving the sale on your side? Any timing pressure, loan maturity, vacancy, or carrying costs pushing this along? And if 600 is a reference point, what\u2019s the best number you can actually live with today? If it has a six-handle, we\u2019re likely too far apart."", ""Round 2.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Hi, very nice to hear back from you. I actually prioritize easy-to-maintain single-family homes, but I have to say that this is n income-producing property. In fact, it once operated as the beloved \""Christmas Elves\"" holiday shop on the ground floor with apartments above.  The reason I would love to sell is that I am currently retired and would love to reduce control of some rental properties. This is definitely a very good one, especially for commercial use, which will help you to gain a lot of profits. 600 is a reference point, and I already think it is below the true value. The current price is still too low. Please let me know your best offer; otherwise, I will just give it to my grandson someday."", ""Round 3.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I hear you on the income history and the Christmas Elves lore, but for my use it\u2019s a heavy lift: change-of-use triggers life-safety, fire separation (potentially sprinklers or an engineered alternative), accessibility upgrades, commercial washrooms, electrical service, facade/egress work, plus whatever the roof/windows/foundation and parking need. That\u2019s real six-figure capex before I can open the doors.\n\nTurnkey residential triples might trade near 600, but this isn\u2019t apples-to-apples. I can stretch to 535,000. That reflects the work and today\u2019s rates/insurance/soft rents.\n\nIf your plan is to hold it for family down the road, I respect that. If you\u2019d rather simplify the portfolio now, I\u2019m a clean, straightforward buyer and we can wrap this quickly. But it has to start with a 5, not a 6. \n\nWhat\u2019s the best number you\u2019d actually sign today? If you can get me close to the low-540s, we likely have a handshake."", ""Round 3.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): I understand your concerns, but I think we're looking at the property from two different vantage points.\n\nI\u2019ve owned and operated income properties here for decades, including this one, and while a change-of-use could certainly invite upgrades, the building has performed reliably as-is for residential use. The value here isn\u2019t only in how it might be repurposed, but in the mixed-use zoning, the location, and the stable revenue potential\u2014all of which are why comparable triplexes have been trading well into the mid-five hundreds.\n\nI appreciate you stretching to $535,000, but that number doesn\u2019t reflect where the market has been for properties of this scale, even in a softer season.  That said, I do want to simplify my portfolio, and you would certainly be a clean, local buyer, which I value.\n\nIf you can move into the 570s, we\u2019re much closer to a number I can sign today.\nI\u2019m not asking for something starting with a 6, but it needs to be meaningfully above 535 to make sense for me.\n\nIf you can sharpen your pencil just a bit more, I think we can shake hands on this."", ""Round 4.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I appreciate you moving off the six-handle. For me, converting this to a commercial build-out is a real cost line, and numbers in the 570s just don\u2019t pencil.\n\nI can do $545,000. Clean, straightforward buyer, quick close. If that works, I\u2019ll get the paperwork over today and we\u2019re done.\n\nIf you truly need the 570s, I\u2019ll tip my hat and step aside. But if there\u2019s any urgency on timing or you\u2019d value a fast, no-fuss finish, 545 is a solid, bankable number."", ""Round 4.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): I appreciate the clarity and the speed you\u2019re offering.\n\nThat said, $545,000 still leaves me too tight once my remaining mortgage, fees, and tax implications are factored in. At that level, I\u2019m effectively selling the property for less than what it is worth as a functioning triplex with mixed-use potential, not just as a commercial shell.\n\nI don\u2019t need the 570s to feel whole, but I do need a number that reflects both the land and the flexibility of the zoning. If you can bring this to $555,000, we can consider it done today \u2014 quick close, clean paperwork, no fuss on my end.\n\nIt\u2019s a small step up from where you are, and it gets me over the threshold where selling now makes more sense than holding it for the family.

I appreciate your candidness but I will have to be upfront with you as well. $485000 is too low for me. 123 Main Street has been a great source of income, primarily because, as you may know, it is zoned for both residential and commercial use. In other words, this means a reliable diversity of income, regardless of larger town-wide economic conditions.\n\nYou also ask why I'm looking to sell now... well I'm retired and quite frankly, maintaining this mix-used property is just too much of a headache for me. I'm looking to take a step back. I believe the value of this property has a lot of upside, the land alone, and I'm optimistic on future economic conditions turning upward very soon. So, between you and me, selling this property isn't an alarming urgency. If the price is right, I'll sell... otherwise, I could easily keep within the family.\n\nWith all this said, and looking at market rates for a mixed-used property, we're going to have to go considerably above your ask... But let's take a step back first... what exactly are you aiming for when you buy a house like this?"", ""Round 2.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I buy these on math, not nostalgia. I\u2019m looking for predictable income today, realistic cap rate in this market, and no big projects hiding around the corner. Mixed-use is great, but I\u2019m not paying for \u201cpotential\u201d I have to create.\n\nAs a standalone rental, this sits mid-500s if it were truly turnkey. It isn\u2019t, and rates are what they are. I can move fast and be a sure close, but my dollars follow the numbers.\n\nTwo questions for me to stretch at all:\n- What\u2019s the current rent roll and any recent vacancies?\n- What price do you actually need to see?\n\nIf you want my next step without all the back-and-forth: I can come up to $505,000 and keep it simple. If you\u2019ve got a specific number in mind, put it on the table and I\u2019ll tell you quickly if I can get there. Also, are you aiming to be done before year-end, or no timing preference?"", ""Round 2.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Well I have no timing preference so I simply can't pay a premium on this. And to be a bit more upfront, recent comparable sales in the area seem to point towards a $600,000 sale... You're asking me to go down a 100k for you. Have you considered again the mix-use rental possibilities. While rentals may be down for the year, you still stand to gain on commercial use.\n\nLet me ask you first... you're a lawyer. What even get's you into the market place. I'm selling this for a reason, I'm retiring and I know how difficult it is to maintain a mix-use property like this. Will this be your first? You're going to have consider many things buying an elaborate property like this. Do you have what it takes? If you look around, you'll easily see me selling this for 560k is a great deal, especially as an entry into this type of business. Take a look, in fact I encourage you. You need to be absolutely sure you want to make the full use of this type of property, it's not like ordinary residential rentals.

I\u2019ve always liked that old \u201cChristmas Elves\u201d spot, even if I\u2019m not exactly a tinsel guy.\n\nStraight to it: the market\u2019s softer right now\u2014lobster prices are down, financing\u2019s tighter, and small multis aren\u2019t trading at peak numbers. As a standalone rental, the building only makes sense for me if I\u2019m buying it right.\n\nI can do $485,000. That\u2019s where the rents and risk pencil out on my side.\n\nWhat\u2019s got you thinking of selling now? Are you looking to move this quickly, or is timing flexible? And are there any pressing issues with the building I should be aware of? If this is something you want off your plate soon, I\u2019m prepared to move fast on the number I\u2019ve put down."", ""Round 1.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Hello. It's lovely to see you again after so long! How are things with you and the law practice? I'm glad to see you back on our street again. I am glad to hear that you're interested in purchasing the property, it's a fantastic one, even a neighbourhood teasure to many. I am wanting to sell since I was to focus on single-family homes. What peaks your interest about the property, in terms of what you would like to do with it?"", ""Round 2.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, things are good, thanks. I\u2019m keeping plenty busy at court, but I want a small professional hub right in town\u2014quiet offices, meeting space, maybe a storefront element that fits the street. I\u2019d keep the look and feel; I know folks are sentimental about the place.\n\nYou mentioned shifting focus to single-family\u2014are you trying to redeploy capital soon? Any timing pressure on your side? If you want it off your plate quickly, I can move fast and straightforward.\n\nOn my end, the math is driven by today\u2019s market\u2014rents, rates, and the work these older buildings usually need. Before I throw more time at inspections: how old is the roof, any electrical upgrades (knob-and-tube or panels), foundation or moisture issues, and are there any open permits? Those items swing what I can justify.\n\nI\u2019m still at $485,000 for a clean, quick deal. If you were hoping for something different, what number did you have in mind? Let\u2019s see if we\u2019re even in the same ballpark."", ""Round 2.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): That is a lovely plan, Fred! I hope that you have a lot of success with your new project. Yes, there is a bit of lingerng mortgage and some fees. Since we both would like to make a deal, would you be willing to cover the lingering mortgage and remining fees as well? All other parts of the house are in great condition!"", ""Round 3.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I appreciate that. And I\u2019m glad to hear it\u2019s in solid shape.\n\nOn the mortgage and fees: those get paid out of your sale proceeds at closing. I\u2019m not taking on your debt or tacking on extras. Let\u2019s keep it simple\u2014one clean purchase price, I handle my standard closing costs, you handle yours.\n\nGiven rates, rents, and the age risk on a triplex, I\u2019m at $485,000 for a straightforward deal. I can have a deposit and agreement to you this week and close in about 3 weeks after a quick look at the roof, electrical panel, and foundation\u2014nothing exotic.\n\nIf you need more than that, what\u2019s the sharpest number you can actually do to get this wrapped up now? If we\u2019re too far apart, I\u2019ll likely stick with other options on Starrs Road, so I\u2019d rather know today."", ""Round 3.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Fantastic, that is wonderful! What is the range price, highest and lowest, that you are willing to do? I really think that this is a fantastic home, and I own over 100 rental properties! She is an absolute gem. Also, the economy will bounce back for sure. Us on the east coast know a thing or two about perseverance and grit!"", ""Round 4.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I love the grit, but I buy on today\u2019s numbers, not tomorrow\u2019s hopes.\n\nFor me, this sits in a tight band: $485,000 on the low end, $505,000 as an absolute ceiling after a quick look at roof/panel/foundation. If you want it simple and done, I\u2019ll do $495,000, clean deal.\n\nIf you truly need more than that, give me the sharpest sell-now number you can actually live with and I\u2019ll tell you straight whether I can stretch."", ""Round 4.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): I really appreciate that, Fred! I know that you really care about our neighbourhood and the people wo live in Yarmouth. Can you do $600,000? I think turning this into a commercial opportunity, for instance as it is zoned for both residential and commercial use. I believe that this home and the land is worth every penny! Other houses on the market have sold for this. But, I do want to sell to you instead of another buyer since you grew up next door. I'd be willing to go a bit under $600,000 if that means we can close a deal and help one another out."", ""Round 5.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I hear you, but $600,000 isn\u2019t going to work for me.\n\nHere\u2019s me stretching to try to meet you: $535,000, clean and quick. That reflects today\u2019s rents, rates, and the conversion/build-out I\u2019ll have to do, even with the mixed-use zoning.\n\nIf you can do $535,000, I\u2019ll sign and put the deposit up right away.

You\u2019re too kind. I\u2019m well\u2014busy as ever. And yeah, I picked up the spot next door because I\u2019m mapping out a larger footprint.

AI seems to be a good bet and I'd also like to invest a bit more in fixed income given the overall direction of the market.

Heritage quirks don\u2019t help the budget either.\n\nHere\u2019s where I am: $495,000.\n\nThat\u2019s a clean, simple number that reflects the current market and the work I\u2019d have to do to make the space useful. If you\u2019re motivated to move it, I can be decisive.\n\nWhat\u2019s got you selling now? Is timing critical for you, or are you testing the waters? And have you had any serious offers yet? If your expectations are higher, tell me where you\u2019re aiming so I can see if there\u2019s any daylight."", ""Round 1.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Wassup Fred.\nThanks for making the offer.\nWell, personally, I\u2019m tryna get retired soon and therefore I wanna focus on single-family housing as I go on. These more complex properties takes a lot of effort to manage and I don\u2019t want to have to do that. I can if I have to though.\n\nAnd for the price, I gotta say I was expecting a higher price. I was looking at recent comparable sales and it pegs this property to around 600 k.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m kinda curious why are you tryna buy this property? I remember that you inherited a house earlier but didn\u2019t really take the time to take care of it. As a big-name lawyer why are you suddenly taking up housing like this?"", ""Round 2.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I hear you. Triplexes are work, and getting lighter before you retire makes sense.\n\nOn my side, I\u2019m not turning into a landlord. I want a straightforward street-level footprint for my practice\u2014offices, a couple conference rooms, some public-facing space. The \u201cChristmas Elves\u201d setup isn\u2019t plug-and-play for that, and the heritage bits mean more approvals and more cost before I can do anything.\n\nThat\u2019s why my number sits where it sits. The comps you\u2019re looking at for ~600 are mostly turnkey rentals. This one needs a change of use and real money to make it functional for me. Backing out that spend puts me under five.\n\nSo here\u2019s where I am: 495,000, clean and simple. If you need to see movement, I can sharpen to 505,000 for a quick yes. If you\u2019re thinking \u201csix-handle,\u201d I\u2019m not your buyer.\n\nLevel with me: have you actually had any written offers yet? And where do you need to be to feel good walking away from this one, given you\u2019re streamlining before retirement? If timing matters\u2014this month versus spring\u2014say so."", ""Round 2.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Well, while I don\u2019t have any other offers yet, I do have alternative plans for the property if it can\u2019t be sold. If no other buyers come along I can simply leave it for my grand kids.\n\nAs for the renovation you mentioned. Could you give me an estimate of how much it will cost to renovate the place? Ideally a detailed breakdown, so that I can see where I can help you cut down the renovation prices and maximize the pie between us."", ""Round 3.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I get the \u201cleave it to the grandkids\u201d option. Totally fair. But right now the market\u2019s soft, rates are heavy, and nobody\u2019s lining up with offers. If you want to simplify before retirement, this is the window to cash out clean.\n\nYou asked about renos. Rough, practical numbers for turning the ground floor into office/meeting space and cleaning up the building systems:\n\n- Accessibility/code (barrier\u2011free washroom, door hardware, change\u2011of\u2011use items): ~20k\n- Electrical and lighting rework (service, panels, LED, emergency/exit): ~18k\n- HVAC upgrades/rebalance (zoned comfort for offices): ~22k\n- Interior reconfiguration (demo, framing, doors, glass for conference rooms): ~25k\n- Finishes/flooring/paint (durable commercial spec): ~12k\n- Data/security (cabling, rack, cameras, access control): ~8k\n- Storefront/signage tweaks (visibility, entry): ~10k\n- Soft costs (architect/engineer, permits, heritage approvals): ~12k\n- Contingency: ~8k\n\nCall it ~135k, and that\u2019s without surprises. That\u2019s why I\u2019m where I am on price.\n\nI\u2019m not looking for you to do work or get fancy\u2014price is the lever. I\u2019ll do it as\u2011is, quick close.\n\nSo here\u2019s my move: 505,000, clean, as\u2011is, I\u2019ll have docs out today and close in 30 days. If you need to be higher, tell me your real bottom line\u2014if it starts with a five, there may be a path. If you\u2019re holding out for a six\u2011handle, I won\u2019t chase it. Where do you need to be to say yes?"", ""Round 3.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Yea I can tell you my ideal price goes a bit higher but can start with a five. But hear me out, the prices you listed for reno, I get it. But think about it, if you wanna get an office somewhere in this town, it\u2019s gonna cost u that much anyway. Doesn\u2019t matter which property you buy you gotta pay for that. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to make those renovations come out of my pocket.\n\nI get it that lobsters are down in prices, and property sales do soften a little bit. From what I know, the property next door works 450k but got sold for 400 recently. I\u2019m happy to reference that proportion 400/450 times 600 = 533k."", ""Round 4.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I get your math, but the 600 base you\u2019re using is a landlord\u2019s number for a stabilized triplex. I\u2019m not buying a turnkey rental. Using your own 400/450 comp ratio on a more realistic 550 baseline puts it under 490\u2014which is right where I opened.\n\nThat said, I\u2019d rather get this done than keep haggling. I\u2019ll move to 512,500, as\u2011is, clean, 30\u2011day close, proof of funds today. If you can do that, we have a deal right now.\n\nIf you need to be above the low fives, I\u2019m not chasing it. Can you say yes at 512,500?"", ""Round 4.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): I can say to low fives but not 512500. What you wanna do with the property is your business. I just care about the sales of a property. And to me, a property is a property. Again, I understand that you\u2019re not looking for residential housing but office spaces. But, again, in this town, this property is probably the best you can get and I don\u2019t think you can find better options given that I own hundreds of properties here and it\u2019s a small town. Also, think about the strategic location and fame of this property. It does you good."", ""Round 5.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, fair enough\u2014you\u2019re in the low fives but not 512,500.

I\u2019ve walked 123 Main a few times over the years\u2014nice bones, but it\u2019s a tougher market right now. Rates are high, lobster\u2019s down, and small multis in town have been trading off a bit. As a straight rental I\u2019m seeing comps in the 550\u2013600 range, then backing out for capex risk, financing costs, and tenant/vacancy exposure. On that basis, I\u2019m at 485,000 for the property.\n\nI\u2019m disciplined on price and looking high-400s/low-500s unless the numbers clearly support more. If you think there\u2019s a case above that, show me the data and I\u2019ll look at it. A few quick questions so I can sanity-check:\n\n- What\u2019s driving your timing to sell? Anything pressing on your end?\n- Do you have other offers in hand or a specific price you\u2019re expecting?\n- Current rent roll: units, rents, who\u2019s month-to-month vs. fixed term, any arrears or vacancies?\n- Recent and needed work: roof, electrical (any knob-and-tube), plumbing, heat source and age, windows, insulation, foundation, moisture issues?\n- Taxes and insurance last year? Any unusual operating costs?\n- Any heritage designations or restrictions that would slow approvals or renovations?\n\nI\u2019m evaluating a couple of different avenues in town right now, so I won\u2019t chase.

I get the optimism, but 700\u2013800 doesn\u2019t pencil for me. At today\u2019s small\u2011multi cap rates, 700k implies roughly 56k+ in annual NOI.

I\u2019m not chasing rentals, and I won\u2019t chase price.\n\nIf you want me to stretch, I need the facts:\n- Current rent roll (rents, term vs. M2M, arrears, vacancies)\n- Last 12 months\u2019 expenses (taxes, insurance, utilities if landlord\u2011paid, maintenance)\n- Capex: roof age, heating system and fuel, electrical (any knob\u2011and\u2011tube), windows/insulation, plumbing, foundation/moisture\n- Any heritage restrictions I should factor\n\nYou mentioned passing it to your grandson if price isn\u2019t there\u2014totally fair.

If we can agree at that number, I\u2019ll have paperwork out tonight.\n\nA couple of quick questions so I\u2019m not swinging in the dark:\n- What timing are you hoping for on a sale?\n- Have you had other offers or guidance on where you expect this to land?\n- If speed and certainty matter, what range gets this done now?"", ""Round 1.2 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Hi, nice to mmet you. Thank you for your interest in this house. However, I cannot accept the price of 475 at this moment. the price on my side would be 570k.

Proof of funds today, light inspection (structural/ENV only), and I can close in about three weeks.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got real offers north of 550 right now, I won\u2019t chase. If not, what\u2019s your sharpest number today? If you can get into the low-5s, we can likely wrap this up this week.\n\nAlso, can you share the specific comps and current rent roll/NOI you\u2019re using to support 570?

Clean and certain.\n\nPrice is where we\u2019re apart. 600 doesn\u2019t pencil for me in this market\u2014rates are still biting, lobster down has softened demand, and a triplex of this vintage still carries near\u2011term CapEx risk.

I remember when you were just a young boy and its been so exciting to see your career successes. I know you've got the two-unit behind the triplex, but I haven't known you to be in the rental market like I am in Yarmouth, so would love to understand why you're interested in the spot. \n\nPersonally, I'm a big fan of the property -- multifamily housing is certainly the best type of rental property from a cashflow standpoint -- so if you're looking to get into the rental game this is a great starting point. That said, I'm also not especially eager to get rid of it so will need to get the right price."", ""Round 1.2 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, great to see you too. I\u2019ve always liked that stretch of Main for visibility and practicality\u2014this isn\u2019t me trying to be a landlord, it\u2019s me keeping my base of operations tidy and close to court.\n\nOn price, I have to be disciplined. With the age of the building, rising insurance and taxes, turnover risk in town with lobster prices where they are, and some inevitable capex, it pencils for me in the high fours. I\u2019m at $480,000 for a clean, straightforward deal and I can move quickly.\n\nWhat number would make this easy for you today? And is there any timing or capital need driving a sale, or are you just testing if the market will pay? Also, are you talking to anyone else on it right now?"", ""Round 2.1 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Good to understand you're looking to shore up your base. That said, I'm a bit afraid we might be a bit too far apart when it comes to pricing. I'm not in any big rush to sell - the property is cashflowing great, and even in the worst case I could see myself passing the home on to my grandson. I know that lobster isn't doing so well now, but I'm very confident it will rebound. That said, I'm very willing to sell now for the right price, not just testing the market. To make this easy, I'd need $612k, which is where I'd put the value of the property given the value this property could bring as a rental and -- like you said -- its prime location on main. I've put a lot into maintaining the property, so while you might want to do some work to convert it to your base, there really isn't as much work that NEEDs to be done."", ""Round 2.2 - Fred Starr (Buyer): I appreciate the care you\u2019ve put into it, Rosalind.

I understand the other risks so perhaps if we cant get to the right pricing range I'll look to find another buyer.

I'm still looking for something at $600,000+.  Could I move you closer to that range?

If that's alright, I have a couple questions first. \n- Is this house the only house you're looking to buy?\n- Why do you want to buy it? What matters to you personnally about the location/the house?\n- What price are you hoping for? I have to say, recent comparable sales peg the property\u2019s value at $2 million dollars.\nThank you for your interest, I look forward to hearing back."", ""Round 1.2 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, nice to see you too.\n\n- I\u2019m looking at a few options, not just 123 Main\u2014some mixed\u2011use spots and a couple along Starrs Road.\n- What matters to me is straightforward commercial use, good visibility, and parking. I\u2019m not chasing nostalgia\u2014the numbers have to pencil.\n- On price: $2M isn\u2019t in the realm for a Yarmouth triplex. On income and recent local sales, the standalone value is mid\u2011500s at best. I\u2019m at $485,000.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got comps that truly support $2M, please send the addresses\u2014I\u2019m not seeing anything comparable locally. Also, what\u2019s your timing? Any urgency on your end, current rent roll, vacancies, or big-ticket repairs coming due?\n\nIf we\u2019re playing in a realistic range, I can move quickly."", ""Round 2.1 - Rosalind Cain (Seller): Thank you so much for your reply.\nCould you elaborate on good visibility and parking? What exactly does that mean, what are you looking for?\nAlso I am curious about two-unit home behind 123 Main Street you inherited years ago, I expected you to try and sell that house to me! What are your plans with this new house? \n\nIt seems we have differing views on the houses' value. Some of my competitors' sales have resulted in sales in the millions, hence this price. The pure standalone value, however, is at 650,000 at best, according to a recent valuation I have had done by an independent valuer. \n\nWhy are you at $485,000 if you consider the standalone value to be mid-500s at best? That's a $65k difference. \nIf you're willing to go up to $600,000, I'm also willing to move quicky and sign right now.\n\nThere is no urgency on my end! The house is in perfect state, no big-ticket repairs, I am simply looking to sell as I am in retirement and want to streamline my holdings, focusing on those which require less active management."", ""Round 2.2 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, here\u2019s what I mean by visibility and parking:\n- Clear street frontage for signage that\u2019s visible from Main, not tucked behind trees or porches.\n- Room for 8\u201310 off\u2011street spots without juggling tenants and clients, ideally an easy curb cut and turning radius. 123 has some, but to make it work I\u2019d be reconfiguring and paving\u2014costs I have to factor in.\n\nOn the place behind 123: I\u2019m not selling. It\u2019s stable for me, and I\u2019m not looking to add management complexity\u2014same reason I\u2019m disciplined on price here.\n\nOn value: bankable value in Yarmouth on a triplex is driven by income. With rates where they are, buyers underwrite at 7.5\u20138.5 caps; \u201cperfect state\u201d or not, triplexes take hands\u2011on management, insurance is up, and lobster prices have Main Street soft right now. That\u2019s why I opened at $485k. Offers aren\u2019t appraisals\u2014I start where the risk and unknowns are covered.\n\n600 doesn\u2019t work for me. I can do $515,000, clean and quick. I\u2019ll waive fluff, do standard inspection only, and close in two weeks.\n\nIf you think your valuer\u2019s 650 is the right number, I respect it\u2014but I\u2019m not your buyer at that price. If you\u2019ve got a rent roll and expense breakdown that changes the math, send it and I\u2019ll look. Otherwise, if you can meet me in the low 5s, we can wrap this up now.

If so, how much added value would that create?\n\nThis triplex at 123 Main Street, which is zoned for both residential and commercial use, has served reliably as an income-producing property.

Any consolidation requires surveys/approvals and reconfiguring parking\u2014that\u2019s all on me, not you.\n\nOn the numbers: the caf\u00e9 is a small\u2011operator credit in a town where F&B churns; \u201cNNN\u201d here rarely ends up truly net once you factor snow, roof, and code/fit\u2011up surprises.

There are some maintenance that you took under account in your calculus, but the building is relatively in a great state. It is a high profitable industry with uncomparable ROI, that I think you did not compute in your calculations when determining the NPV.\n\nRegarding my price offer, I had in mind something above, and I think you will have to meet me in the middle.

Once again, I believe the market is not so hot so it is worth more,  but considering the fact that I know you since you were young, and I appreciate your professionalism, i can do gestures. \nI am eager to know about your alternative on Starrs Road: do they have something I cannot offer to you ? \nHow does 580k sound to you?\nThank you."", ""Round 5.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I appreciate you coming to 580.

I\u2019m not wedded to any \u201cChristmas Elves\u201d concept; if I move forward, I\u2019d be reconfiguring and bringing parts of it up to commercial code, which isn\u2019t cheap on an older building.\n\nQuick question for you: what\u2019s got you thinking about selling now? Are you on any particular timeline, or juggling other projects? Also, is there anything I should know about deferred maintenance or heritage-related constraints?\n\nGiven the age, the work I\u2019d need to do, and softer local fundamentals (lobster prices aren\u2019t exactly lifting retail right now), I\u2019m in the neighborhood of $475,000 for a clean, straightforward sale.

However, I still hope to get a market rate for this property based on comparables. I am not on a particular timeline and happy to keep the property until another buyer comes if needed. No additional deferred maintenance or heritage-related constraints. \n\nSince you mentioned lobster prices and commercial use, I know you've clearly done the math on the property and the values.

Let's start with your questions first. The reason I am selling, though not time driven, is that I would want to focus on purely rental properties in the future and not rental and commercial. No big repairs coming up as I have maintained the house well and I am not aware of any zoning/heritage issues. Now to the last question: the price range I am targeting is very different to yours and if $440,000 is a serious offer I doubt that we will come to an agreement. Recent sales peg the value of my house at 600,000 and up and I am keen to get that. I am aware of the downturn in the lobster market at the moment, but that does not justify selling the house under value. The market will recover which means in a little while the house will fetch its value. I am happy to wait until that happens, so if you want to buy I need you to come up a lot with your offer. What about you? What are your plans for the house. I didnt not realise you were in the real estate business. Do you not also own a house very near?"", ""Round 2.1 - Fred Starr (Buyer): Rosalind, I appreciate the straight talk.\n\nOn my end, I\u2019m not in the real estate business per se\u2014I\u2019m a lawyer\u2014but I do own nearby. Owning next door just makes logistics easier for what I\u2019m building out.

I can move quickly and keep conditions light. With rates where they are and winter carry in Yarmouth, the yields don\u2019t support a 6-handle for me.

I understand that you own an adjacent property which presents a unique opportunity to merge the two properties together, which is an exciting proposition. Additionally, the property has been zoned commercial and residential, which presents another opportunity for multiple uses.
