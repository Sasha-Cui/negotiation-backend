    "## 1. Read in all the data in the tables of the db that has taken place whose \"created_at\" column value is after 2025-12-10 14:36\n",
    "## 2. Separate these into two dataframes.  The first one 'scenario_name' is 'Top_talent' and the second one scenario_name' is 'main_street'.  Save these as csvs.\n",
    "## 3. (skipped for now) Visually identify the shortcomings and errors in the deals\n",
    "## 4. Read in the main_street csv, and report the following matters.\n",
    "### 4.1 What is the distribution of the prices at which those deals were reached at?  Contrast this with the midpoint (50-50).\n",
    "### 4.2 Is there statistically significant evidence to show that AI is better than humans?\n",
    "### 4.3 What is the demographic breakdown of this sample, and how do different demographic features explain (or not explain) the variations in student performances?\n",
    "## 5. Read in the top_talent csv, and report the following matters.\n",
    "### 5.1 What is the distribution of the total pie size achieved and the percent pie captured by human?\n",
    "### 5.2 Is there statistically significant evidence to show that AI is better than humans?\n",
    "### 5.3 What is the demographic breakdown of this sample, and how do different demographic features explain (or not explain) the variations in student performances (in making the total pie large and in capturing a larger share of the pie)?\n",
    "### 5.4 What is the treatment variations (who goes first? which role is assigned, candiate or recruiter?) breakdown of this sample, and how do they explain (or not explain) the variations in student performances (in making the total pie large and in capturing a larger share of the pie)?\n"
