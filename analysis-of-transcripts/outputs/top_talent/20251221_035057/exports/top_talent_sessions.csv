If we needed to fine-tune, is there flexibility to trade between base and signing bonus, assuming the 3-month Blair rotation and August start?\n- Blair rotation: Can we lock the 3-month DC rotation with Blair (formal reporting line, clear scope, then move to the main office)?

Maybe you can tell me which one you would prefer and we can start from that as a negotiation basis. Option one is Seoul, a rotation with Blair, start at 1st August, a salary of $165,500, 0 remote work days, bonus of $20,000,  and 3 vacation weeks. Option 2 is Philadelphia, no rotation with Blair, start at 15th July, a salary of $170,000, 1 remote work days, bonus of $40,000,  and 2. vacation weeks. Option 3 is New Haven, no rotation with Blair, start at 5th July, a salary of $170,000, 0 remote work days, bonus of $40,000, and 4 vacation weeks."", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: Appreciate you laying out the three packages\u2014thank you. To set us both up for success, here\u2019s the structure that best aligns with our onboarding plan, team needs, and how we\u2019d expect you to make the biggest impact quickly:\n\n- Start Date: July 5th\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s) / week\n- Signing Bonus: $5,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: No rotation to start\n\nWhy this works: July 5th lines you up with our Q3 launch/onboarding sprint; New Haven is where the marketing build-out and cross-functional partners are concentrated; and a strong in-office presence is key for mentorship and speed. On Blair: we absolutely want you connected to that team, but a formal 3-month DC rotation right away would pull you off the early roadmap\u2014happy to arrange exposure and collaboration without a formal rotation in year one.\n\nIf salary is your top lever, I can explore a modest move while keeping the structure that makes this work. For example, if we keep New Haven, July 5th, 0 remote days, 2 weeks vacation, and no rotation, I can look at:\n- Base up to $140,000 with a $12,500 signing bonus.\n\nAlternatively, if an extra remote day is important, we could consider 1 day/week provided we keep the July 5th start, New Haven location, and 2 weeks vacation.\n\nWhich one or two elements matter most to you\u2014base vs. bonus vs. time off\u2014so I can tune this accordingly?"", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: I can live with no remote days and even potentially just 2 weeks vacation, though I would like to have more. However, the rotation with Blair is important to and so is a higher salary. Even 140,000 is really quite low. So how about $175,000 salary, rotation with Blair, start date 1st August, $3000 signing bonus, 2 weeks holiday and in Seoul"", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate how clear you\u2019ve been on your priorities\u2014and thank you for the movement on remote and vacation. Two things in your latest package won\u2019t work on our side: a 3\u2011month Blair rotation starting Aug 1 and a $175k base. The rotation would pull you off the Q3 build and requires policy exceptions we won\u2019t get approved for this role; and $175k is outside our structure for a Director-level marketing hire.\n\nHere\u2019s a package I can get approved now that aligns you to the team\u2019s plan and gives you strong near-term cash while keeping the base sustainable:\n\n- Start Date: July 5th\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $140,000\n- Signing Bonus: $12,500 (paid on first payroll)\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s)/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: No formal rotation in year one\n\nTo honor your Blair interest, we\u2019ll set up a structured mentorship path:\n- Monthly 1:1s with Blair and inclusion in GA pipeline reviews\n- A dedicated DC immersion week in Q4 tied to a specific initiative\n- Revisit a short-term DC stint after the first two quarters, based on roadmap progress\n\nIf you truly need a little more runway to move, I can flex the start to July 15th with the same package. If the only open variable is base vs. sign-on, I can also structure it as $142,500 base with a $10,000 sign-on while keeping the rest identical.\n\nIf we can align on New Haven, July start, and no formal Blair rotation this year, I can lock this in today. How does that land?"", ""Round 3.1 - The Candidate: To be honest, this is better but not great yet. I can tell that New Haven is important to you and even though it is my last choice, I can make it happen if it helps you. The Blair rotation is also very important to me and I can tell you do not want to budge on that. If thats the case that is two big concessions that I have to make so I hope you can meet me on start date and salary. The 1st of August is important to me, and so is my salary. I truly believe that I am worth at least $165,000 and would like you to meet me near that at least. Obviously I want to optimise my bonus as well, but I am happy to keep the bonus lower and add it to the salary instead if that makes it better for you. Maybe we can up the holidays to 3 weeks as well"", ""Round 3.2 - The Recruiter: I really appreciate the movement you\u2019ve made\u2014shifting to New Haven and being fine with 0 remote days are big helps to the team. On Blair, a formal 3\u2011month rotation isn\u2019t something I can approve for year one, but I will commit to structured mentorship (monthly 1:1s, GA pipeline reviews) and a DC immersion week in Q4 tied to a concrete initiative.\n\nGiven your focus on base over bonus, here are two clear paths:\n\nOption A (salary-forward, July start):\n- Start Date: July 15\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $145,000 (top of our Director band)\n- Signing Bonus: $0 (shift value into base as you prefer)\n- Remote: 0 day/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: No formal rotation in year one (mentorship + DC immersion as above)\n\nOption B (if August 1 is essential):\n- Start Date: August 1\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $140,000\n- Signing Bonus: $0\n- Remote: 0 day/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: No formal rotation in year one (mentorship + DC immersion as above)\n\nI can\u2019t do 3 weeks vacation for this role right now; the team needs you fully integrated in Q3\u2013Q4. If Option A works, I can get the letter out today. If August 1 is a must, confirm Option B and I\u2019ll move quickly. Which path would you like to lock in?""]",,

The compensation reflects the scope and the growth mandate we discussed, and the signing bonus helps with the transition.\n\nCould you share a bit on:\n- Where you have the most flexibility between base, signing bonus, and vacation?\n- How strongly the firm needs coverage by location\u2014does Philadelphia work, or is there priority pressure in New Haven or Seoul?\n- The policy bounds for remote work at the director level?\n\nHappy to walk through each piece and trade on the margins to land something that fits your budget and policies while setting us up for success."", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: Thank you! And nice to meet you too. Super excited about this opportunity and would love to get you on board.\n\nHere is what I propose:\n\nNew Haven location \u2013 we really need your talent here. This is a main priority for us.\n2 weeks vacation \u2013 our standard package.\n$140,000 salary \u2013 higher than our usual base.\n$10,000 signing bonus.\n0 remote days/week \u2013 this works well, as you said you prefer being on-site.\nJuly 5th start.\nNo Blair rotation.\n\nWe think you actually don\u2019t need the Blair rotation and will be just fine with the onboarding activities here at the firm.\n\nWhere we really need you is in New Haven. Two weeks is the most we can offer for vacation. Can you let us know your priorities here? Regarding the August start date\u2014is that flexibility for you personally, or is it tied to the Blair rotation timing? Additionally, help me understand the $190k ask. What comparable offers are you benchmarking against?"", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Appreciate the quick response and the clarity. I\u2019m genuinely excited to join and want to land a package we can both say yes to today. A few priorities from my side to set me up for success:\n\n- Start date: Needs to be August. I can commit to Monday, August 5. July 5 won\u2019t work on my end.\n- In-person: 0 remote days/week works perfectly.\n- Location/Vacation: I hear you on New Haven priority and the 2-week standard. If vacation truly can\u2019t move, I\u2019m comfortable converting that into compensation. If location must be New Haven, I can work with that provided we get the economics and August start right.\n\nHere are two complete paths that get us there\u2014pick the one that fits your constraints best:\n\nPackage A (Philadelphia + Blair rotation)\n- Work location: Philadelphia, PA (home base)\n- Blair rotation: 3-month DC rotation with Blair, then main office\n- Start date: Monday, August 5\n- Base salary: $190,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 3.5 weeks\n\nPackage B (New Haven emphasis)\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Start date: Monday, August 5\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks (if that\u2019s truly fixed)\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Base salary: $200,000 with the Blair DC rotation\n  OR, if no Blair rotation, Base salary: $205,000\n\nWhy this makes sense:\n- Salary: Director-level Online Marketing roles in biopharma/health-tech across the Northeast commonly range into the 170\u2013200k band for base; the scope we discussed (growth mandate, cross-functional leadership, and building a high-impact team) warrants the top end. The NH move and the fixed 2 weeks of vacation further support a stronger base and signing bonus.\n- Signing bonus: Helps with relocation and transition; keeping it at $40k smooths the move and offsets the vacation cap.\n- August 5 start: Ensures I arrive rested and ready to hit the ground running. If helpful, I can do light planning calls in July so we\u2019re queued up for week one.\n\nA few quick checks so we can finalize:\n- Is 2 weeks vacation absolutely capped, or can 3.0 or 3.5 weeks be approved at the director level?\n- Is New Haven a must-have, or can Philadelphia work if paired with the Blair rotation and a clear presence on-site?\n- What\u2019s your ceiling on signing bonuses at this level? If there\u2019s room above $10k, I\u2019d like to lock $40k to make the transition seamless.\n\nIf we can align on Package A or B (with August 5 locked), I\u2019m ready to sign today."", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate you working with me on this and narrowing the options. Let me be direct about what works and what doesn\u2019t:\n\nOk, let\u2019s try and agree on some things here to get issues out of the way.\n\nAugust 5th start: I can work with this. It\u2019s not ideal for our internal timelines, but I understand your constraints and can give you this.\n0 remote days: Perfect \u2014 we\u2019re aligned.\nNew Haven location: Yes, this is a must-have for us. Philadelphia genuinely has no operational need.\nWe can give you the Blair rotation.\nTwo weeks is our standard Vacation package I unfortunately cant give more vacation to someone new to the crew unless giving you way less salary.\n\nHopefully, with this, you will be able to understand that we cannot offer more than a $140k base salary.

We\u2019re close, and I\u2019m excited to make this work.\n\nI can commit to the following as fixed:\n- Location: New Haven\n- Start: Monday, August 5\n- Blair rotation: 3-month DC rotation with Blair, then main office\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n\nThe only open item is structure. If your year-one cash envelope is $180k (i.e., $140k base + $40k sign-on), let\u2019s refactor it so the base reflects the role and long-term impact. I can sign today on either of these New Haven options:\n\nOption 1 (preferred):\n- Base: $170,000\n- Signing bonus: $30,000\n- All other terms as above\n\nOption 2 (budget-neutral refactor):\n- Base: $165,000\n- Signing bonus: $15,000\n- All other terms as above\n- Note: This keeps year-one cash at $180k while aligning base with market and retention.\n\nIf you can do either of these, I\u2019ll accept on the spot.

Given where key campaigns and product launches are, I\u2019d like to move decisively and lay out a package that gets you onboarded fast and sets you up to lead.\n\nHere\u2019s the offer I\u2019d like to align on as a starting point:\n- Start date: July 5\n- Work location: New Haven, CT (home base)\n- Base salary: $133,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week (in-office role)\n- Signing bonus: $5,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks annually\n- Blair rotation: Not included\n\nThe thinking: New Haven is where the biggest marketing lift is needed and where your impact will be felt immediately. A July 5 start lets you hit onboarding and Q3 planning windows, and in-person presence is important at this level for mentorship and cross-functional velocity. We also offer strong in-office support\u2014extended cafeteria hours, laundry service, wellness coaching\u2014to keep life simple while we\u2019re sprinting.\n\nI want this to work for you as well. If we can align on New Haven, July 5, in-office presence, and standard vacation, I can be more flexible on compensation within our band and structure. Before we explore moves, could you share:\n- Your top two priorities among compensation (base/bonus), location, remote flexibility, vacation, and start timing?\n- Any hard constraints on a July 5 start?\n- How critical is the Blair rotation for you\u2014must-have or nice-to-have exposure that we can handle through projects and stakeholder time without a formal DC rotation?\n\nIf we lock the core pieces, I\u2019m confident we can tune the rest to make this a clear yes for you."", ""Round 1.2 - The Candidate: Thank you for this overview and for sharing your expectations so clearly, I really appreciate the transparency.\n\nBefore going line by line, I think it could be helpful to take a step back and look at the full package, since for me many of these elements are quite linked and hard to evaluate in isolation.\n\nOn timing specifically, I have to say that I would strongly prefer to start around August 1st for personal reasons, and I also think it would allow me to show up with the best possible energy and focus. That said, I genuinely want to find solutions that work for both of us, so I\u2019d love to better understand why the July 5th date is particularly important on your end,  maybe there\u2019s a creative way to bridge that.\n\nWhen it comes to the Blair rotation, I personally see the early exposure to government affairs as strategically very valuable. I think it would give me knowledge and perspective that would directly translate into stronger performance in this role. I\u2019m curious to hear what kinds of projects or exposure you think could offer a similar benefit, because from where I\u2019m sitting right now, the rotation feels like something that would benefit me personally but also make me a stronger asset for the company quite quickly.\n\nOne area I\u2019ve reflected on carefully is the work arrangement. I did think seriously about flexibility early on, especially in light of the proposed location and vacation structure. That said, I understand why a fully on-site presence is important for this role, and I\u2019m prepared to commit to that so I can integrate quickly and deliver impact early on. Because that choice does involve real trade-offs on my side, I\u2019d like us to approach the rest of the package with the same level of intentionality, so that overall it feels balanced and sustainable for me as well.\n\nFinally, I do want to flag that compensation is a core pillar for me in evaluating this offer. Based on my experience, market context, and the scope of this role, both base salary and signing bonus matter a lot to me in making the package compelling. I\u2019m very open to discussing structure and trade-offs, but I do want to be transparent early on that the initial numbers feel quite low from my perspective. I\u2019d love to understand a bit more about how you think about salary and bonus decisions internally and what flexibility might exist there."", ""Round 2.1 - The Recruiter: Appreciate the candid context\u2014thank you. Here\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about the key items you raised:\n\nWhy July 5 matters\n- We kick off Q3 plans and budget allocations that week; you\u2019d lead channel strategy inputs that inform August launches.\n- Our cross-functional leadership offsite and your onboarding cohort run in mid-July; starting July 5 lets you hit both.\n- Waiting to August means missing the first cycle where you\u2019d set direction rather than inherit it.\n\nBlair exposure without a 3-month DC rotation\n- We can\u2019t commit to a formal 3-month DC rotation out of the gate. That said, I\u2019ll build a structured GovAffairs immersion:\n  - Blair as exec sponsor with biweekly 1:1s in Q3.\n  - Seat on the Policy-to-GTM workstream with direct visibility into regulatory timelines shaping digital campaigns.\n  - Two 3\u20134 day DC immersions in the first 90 days for Hill/agency meetings and stakeholder mapping.\n  - Monthly GovAffairs x Marketing roundtable, plus pre-reads and debriefs to translate insights into channel tests.\nThis gets you the perspective quickly while keeping momentum in New Haven.\n\nCompensation\n- Base: We anchor to scope and internal equity around $135k. That\u2019s the right spot for this role.\n- Sign-on: This is where I have the most flexibility to recognize your transition and your commitment to be fully on-site.\n\nIf we align on the core package\u2014New Haven as home base, July 5 start, in-office (0 remote), 2 weeks vacation, and no formal 3\u2011month DC rotation\u2014I can approve today:\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Signing bonus: $15,000\n- Other terms as above\n\nIf we do that, are you comfortable committing? If not, can you share the exact base and signing bonus numbers that would have you say yes now, assuming New Haven + July 5 + in-office + 2 weeks + no 3\u2011month DC rotation are fixed?\n\nAlso, on timing: is August 1 a hard constraint, or could you make July 5 work if we finalize comp and the Blair immersion plan? If there\u2019s a specific blocker, tell me what it is and let\u2019s see if we can solve it."", ""Round 2.2 - The Candidate: On timing, I understand why July 5 is attractive from a planning and onboarding perspective. That said, August 1 really remains my strong preference, especially given that I\u2019m already showing flexibility on being fully on-site and anchoring in New Haven, which are not my ideal outcomes. If those two elements stay fixed, starting August 1 would make a big difference for me in terms of sustainability and starting at my best.\n\nOn the Blair rotation, I appreciate the thought you\u2019ve put into the GovAffairs immersion. I want to be transparent that while those elements sound valuable, they don\u2019t fully substitute for a formal rotation for me. If a 3-month DC rotation is extremely difficult structurally, then I think that gap needs to be balanced elsewhere in the package. The same goes for the 2 weeks of vacation only which is very low especially considering that your company values work-life balance.\n\nI think there are a lot of factors ot condor in this package and I really think taht we should be discussing those I can let you know that with the package <ou ahve currently offered a compensation of 135k and bonus of 15k feels extremely low. To be concrete, if those elements are fixed as described, I would be looking at a base salary in the $195k\u2013$205k range, with signing bonus (which should be larger than 15k) on top, for the offer to feel workable on my side. I\u2019m not attached to a single lever here, and I\u2019m very open to structure and trade-offs, but I wanted to be direct about how I\u2019m thinking about the total package given the constraints.\n\nI\u2019m still very interested in making this work, and I think there\u2019s a deal here, but it probably requires us to keep flexibility across timing, rotation, vacation, and compensation rather than locking everything except pay. Let me know where you see the most room to move and we can work from there."", ""Round 3.1 - The Recruiter: I appreciate how thoughtfully you\u2019re weighing the whole package. Let me be equally clear about where I can and can\u2019t move so we can see if we have a deal today.\n\nOn base: I can\u2019t get anywhere near 195\u2013205. Director calibration for this scope and internal parity land at $135,000. That\u2019s the right base here.\n\nOn location/onsite: Thank you for leaning in on New Haven and 0-remote\u2014those are critical at this level.\n\nOn vacation: We need to keep it at 2 weeks to protect momentum in a very busy period. We\u2019ll back that with the in-office perks and proactive workload planning.\n\nOn Blair: We can\u2019t do a formal 3-month DC rotation. What I will commit to:\n- Blair as exec sponsor with biweekly 1:1s in Q3\n- Seat on the Policy\u2192GTM workstream\n- Two DC immersions (3\u20134 days each) in the first 90 days for Hill/agency exposure\n- Monthly GovAffairs x Marketing roundtable, with debriefs to translate into channel tests\n\nOn timing: July 5 matters for Q3 planning, the leadership offsite, and your onboarding cohort. If there are specific immovable July commitments, we\u2019ll plan around them using PTO and coverage so you can still start strong.\n\nHere\u2019s the offer I can approve now, reflecting real movement on cash while holding the operating pieces we need:\n- Start date: July 5\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $25,000 (paid in first payroll; standard clawback if you depart within a year)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks annually\n- Blair rotation: Not included (with the structured exposure above)\n\nIf we finalize this package, can you accept and sign today?\n\nIf July 5 is the only blocker, tell me specifically what\u2019s in the way\u2014we can explore whether July 15 solves it. If it\u2019s something else, please give me the exact package you\u2019d say yes to today, knowing base, New Haven, 0-remote, 2 weeks, and no 3-month rotation need to hold."", ""Round 3.2 - The Candidate: I want to be very direct now, because at this point I\u2019m struggling to see how the current package works for me, and I don\u2019t want to drag this out if there isn\u2019t real room to move.\n\nAs it stands, the offer on the table is not acceptable to me. I\u2019ve already been flexible on several dimensions that matter a lot, committing to New Haven despite preferring a different location, agreeing to 0 days of remote work, and being open to giving up a formal DC rotation, and yet the overall package is still heavily tilted in one direction. Two weeks of vacation, a July 5 start, no Blair rotation, and a $135k base simply do not balance given those concessions.\n\nIf we want to keep this conversation going, I need to see material movement, not just incremental adjustments.\n\nConcretely, for me to seriously consider signing, the package would need to move meaningfully across several levers at once, for example:\n\nA material increase in base salary (the current level is the single biggest blocker for me if this doesn't increase drastically closer to 200k we most likely either wont get to a deal or you will have to adjust almost all other aspects of the package)\n\nA signing bonus larger than what you are currently offering\n\nMore vacation time (4 weeks is what would make this feel aligned with the work-life balance you\u2019ve described)\n\nAnd/or more flexibility on timing (at least July 15, with August 1 still being my strong preference)\n\nI want to stress that this isn\u2019t about one single term, it\u2019s about whether the total package reflects the scope of the role and the constraints I\u2019m being asked to accept. Right now, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nI am genuinely interested in the role and in joining the company, but if the offer can\u2019t move in a meaningful way across these dimensions, then I think we\u2019re probably better off being honest that we\u2019re not going to get to a deal.

Concretely, that would mean either:\nan adjustment to base salary, bringing it materially closer to the level I\u2019d expect for this scope and responsibility, or\nan increase in vacation, to at least 3 weeks (with 4 weeks being much more in line with what would make the role sustainable for me)\nI\u2019m not asking to change everything, and I\u2019m not trying to drag this out.

Which two elements are your top priorities? If compensation is one, we can explore options on base and/or bonus; if schedule is another, we can discuss minor flexibility on timing or limited remote after ramp.

I can fully commit starting August 1 or later, and I want to be upfront that this is a real constraint rather than a preference.\nOn Blair: the opportunity to do a 3-month rotation in DC with Blair is extremely compelling to me and directly tied to how I see myself creating long-term value at C&C. Since that rotation already requires an August start, those two items really go together from my perspective.\nOn location: while I understand the logic for New Haven, Philadelphia is where I can be most effective and sustainable long-term. I\u2019m very comfortable being highly present and traveling as needed, especially during onboarding.\nOn remote work: I actually align with your in-office culture and am comfortable with 0 remote days if the overall package reflects that level of commitment.\nOn compensation: given the scope of the role and market context, I\u2019d be looking for a base salary around $165,000, along with a signing bonus to support the transition.\nOn vacation: I\u2019d ideally like to land at 4 weeks, which feels consistent with the work-life balance you described.\nIf we\u2019re thinking in terms of trade-offs, the pillars for me are August 1+ start, the Blair rotation, and Philadelphia. If those are workable, I\u2019m flexible on how we finalize the rest and would be happy to move quickly toward a yes.\nHow does that land from your side?"", ""Round 2.1 - The Recruiter: I really appreciate how clearly you laid out your priorities. Let me be equally clear on what lets you have the most impact fastest on our side.\n\nWhere we need to land to make this work operationally:\n- New Haven as your home base (at least your first 12\u201318 months). That\u2019s where the product, analytics, and creative partners you\u2019ll lead are concentrated. It\u2019s the difference between you moving the needle in quarter one vs. quarter three.\n- No formal 3\u2011month DC rotation. We absolutely want you plugged into Blair\u2019s orbit, but a full rotation would derail onboarding and Q3/Q4 delivery.\n\nIf we align on those two items, I can move money and structure to meet you where you are. Here are two concrete packages for you to choose from:\n\nOption A (mid\u2011July start)\n- Start date: July 15\n- Work location: New Haven, CT (on\u2011site)\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week (travel as needed)\n- Signing bonus: $15,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal rotation; instead we\u2019ll set up a standing monthly DC immersion day with Blair, executive sponsorship, and a defined cross\u2011functional initiative you lead with her team\n\nOption B (earlier start + more transition support)\n- Start date: July 5\n- Work location: New Haven, CT (on\u2011site)\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week (travel as needed)\n- Signing bonus: $20,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal rotation; same structured Blair exposure plan as above\n\nTo help with your July logistics, we can pre\u2011schedule a couple of personal days in late July (outside your PTO) so you can tie up commitments\u2014that way you\u2019re onboarded on our cadence without sacrificing what you need to handle.\n\nOn Philadelphia: I hear that it matters to you. If we make New Haven your base now, I\u2019ll put in writing a 12\u2011month location review with clear success metrics and a scoped path to explore a shift to Philadelphia if the org design supports it at that point.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can tailor this precisely:\n1) What specifically drives the August 1 constraint\u2014relocation, a major deliverable, something else? If we solve for that with the July 15 option plus some planned flex, is mid\u2011July viable?\n2) On the Blair collaboration, if we formalize the monthly DC immersion, plus quarterly strategy offsites with her team where you co\u2011lead a priority initiative, does that get you the development and exposure you\u2019re aiming for without a 3\u2011month rotation?\n\nIf you\u2019re open to New Haven and the structured Blair plan, pick Option A or B and I\u2019ll have a clean agreement drafted today.""]",,

I\u2019ll bring a biochemistry foundation plus five years leading digital growth in NYC, and I want to be embedded with the team in person to drive cross-functional execution.\n- I\u2019m committing to being on-site (0 remote), which I\u2019ve found drives faster results, tighter collaboration, and better mentoring for me and my team.\n- The scope and targets we discussed are substantial; $190k reflects the market for high-impact Directors in this lane and the value I intend to deliver.\n\nA few quick checks so we can button this up:\n- Can you confirm that a 3-month DC rotation under Blair, starting after August 1 and followed by a transition to the main office, is feasible on your end?\n- What\u2019s the salary band for this role, and would $190k be within approvable range for a top candidate?\n- Blair mentioned a $40k signing bonus could be possible for the right hire \u2014 is that ceiling available here?\n- Is the company comfortable with an in-office, 0-remote arrangement at the Director level?\n- Is 4 weeks of vacation within policy, or what\u2019s the typical cap?\n- Philadelphia as my long-term home office works best \u2014 can we lock that in?\n\nIf this package fits your constraints, I\u2019m ready to sign.

Let us discuss your expectations one by one. We see no problem with the DC rotation under Blair, however we would greatly appreciate it if you could start on July 5th. This is extremely important for us as our new hires get onboarded on acquainted with the key deliverables during that month, something we see as paramount for you to be able to hit the ground running. Your current salary expectations are somewhat out of budget for us right now. We were thinking at something closer to $10.000 a month or $120.000 per year. Regarding the signing bonus, we usually discuss it with our candidates on a case by case basis. Could you elaborate on what your preferences between signing bonus or a base payment adjustment are? Moving on to our remote work policy, we are aligned with your view. We believe that especially at the director level, impact is easier to achieve in person. Regarding location and Vacation time, we believe your services would be most impactful in our New Haven office and are willing to offer you an additional week of paid time off in comparison to your future colleagues. This would amount to 3 weeks of paid time off. Could you tell me why you value Philadelphia so much? Would you be willing to take lower pay to work in Philadelphia? If so, how much?"", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Appreciate the clarity.

If $170k base is tight, tell me your best approvable base assuming the $40k bonus is in place.\n- Philadelphia: It\u2019s close to home, but I won\u2019t trade meaningful base for location. Given your New Haven preference, I\u2019m willing to plant roots there if we align on the package above.\n\nA few quick confirms so we can wrap this:\n- Can you confirm the $40k signing bonus ceiling is available here?\n- What\u2019s the salary band ceiling for a top-of-band candidate?\n- Is 4 weeks PTO approvable at Director, or what\u2019s the maximum exception you can authorize?\n\nIf you can greenlight Aug 5 + Blair rotation + $170k base + $40k bonus + 4 weeks PTO with New Haven and 0-remote, I\u2019m ready to sign today.

You\u2019ll have faster decision cycles, bigger scope, and more visibility from day one.\n- July 5th aligns with our Q3 campaign build and onboarding cohort\u2014maximizes your early wins.\n- Salary is within band for Directors; we prefer to invest in upside via scope and rapid impact. Bonus is a warm welcome.\n- We keep executives in-office to strengthen mentorship and velocity\u2014your 0\u2011remote preference fits perfectly.\n- On Blair: while a 3\u2011month DC rotation isn\u2019t standard, I can commit to meaningful access without a formal rotation\u2014for example, monthly 1:1s with Blair, quarterly DC working sessions, and placing you as digital lead on a cross-functional initiative Blair sponsors. That gives you the exposure you want without disrupting your first 90 days.\n\nI also hear you on Philadelphia and Seoul. If New Haven is truly off the table, Seoul is the next best landing spot for us. If we pursue Seoul instead of New Haven, I\u2019ll need to preserve the July 5th start and no formal Blair rotation, and keep vacation at 2 weeks; in exchange, I can explore more room on the signing bonus before touching base salary.\n\nTo help me tailor the next move, what are your top two must-haves among: Philadelphia vs. Seoul, a formal 3\u2011month Blair rotation, August 1 start, 4 weeks vacation, $180k base, and a $40k sign-on? If we can get alignment on location (ideally New Haven, or Seoul as a fallback) and skip the formal rotation, I can prioritize improving the cash elements you care about most."", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Thank you for letting me know. If I'm being completely honest I feel that your offer is ignoring almost every single one of my considerations - which is a little disappointing if I'm being honest. The only thing you seem to offer me is that remote work is off the table, which naturally benefits you but is just a personal work choice for me. I can forgo the Blair rotation but only if you consider a higher salary and signing bonus. For the location, I cannot do New Haven at all. How about this: Seoul work location, no Blair rotation, start date August 1st (since I am relocating), base salary $175,000, no remote work, signing bonus $40,000 (since I am relocating), 3.5 week vacation time. This seems like an incredibly generous offer in my opinion. Can you please let me know how many points each of your factors is worth to you?"", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: Appreciate the candor\u2014and thank you for the flexibility you\u2019ve already shown. I hear you on three priorities: Seoul over New Haven, an August 1 start to make relocation sane, and meaningful cash up front. I can fully align to those while keeping us within our internal bands.\n\nHere\u2019s a package I can commit to today:\n- Start date: August 1st\n- Work location: Seoul, Korea\n- Base salary: $138,000\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (paid with first payroll; framed as relocation support)\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal 3\u2011month DC rotation\n\nRationale:\n- Salary sits within our Director band and keeps long\u2011term comp sustainable; we\u2019re channeling more into the sign\u2011on to support your move.\n- Locking Seoul, Aug 1, 0\u2011remote, and no formal rotation sets you up to hit the ground running with the team that needs you most.\n- If we can align on base and vacation at these levels, I\u2019ll lock the rest immediately and we can wrap this up today.\n\nOn your question about how we internally weigh factors: I can\u2019t disclose internal scoring, but I can be transparent on constraints\u2014base salary must stay within band, we strongly prefer in\u2011office presence, and we prioritize getting you seated where the team impact is highest.\n\nIf you can agree to $138k base and 2.5 weeks vacation with the Seoul/Aug 1/$40k sign\u2011on package above, I\u2019m ready to finalize."", ""Round 3.1 - The Candidate: Ok, this is looking a lot better for both of us. I appreciate you keeping an open mind. On second thought, I think I can also compromise on location with New Haven under a few conditions. In return for relocating to New Haven I would like to have a higher base salary. I believe that $170,000 is fair for this, keeping in mind I am in your growth-critical office."", ""Round 3.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate you being open to New Haven\u2014that\u2019s exactly where your impact will be biggest. On base, though, $170k is outside our Director band and isn\u2019t something I can do.\n\nHere\u2019s a package I can commit to today for New Haven:\n- Start date: August 1\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $140,000\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (paid with first payroll; framed for relocation)\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal 3\u2011month DC rotation\n\nIf you can align on the $140k base and 2.5 weeks, I can lock this and get the paperwork out today.\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer a touch more base, I can offer an alternative:\n- Start date: July 15\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $142,000\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal rotation\n\nBoth keep you in the growth hub, give you the $40k cash up front for relocation, and set you up with in\u2011office leadership visibility from day one.

Honestly, materially this offer is worth exactly the same as your previous one, meaning you really aren't making any compromises whereas I am. I don't mean to sound rude but we are both smart professionals and you know how valuable I am to the firm, otherwise I wouldn't be here. I want to highlight that your current base salary offer is significantly below the market rate. I am willing to move down to 2 weeks of vacation time, but in return I expect you to present me with a base salary around $170,000. I do think that we can lock in some of the other factors, but only once I see that we are making more progress. Here is my offer: Start date: August 1st. Location: New Haven. Base Salary: $170,000.

I really don't want to accept a base salary under $165,000. Can we potentially downgrade the signing bonus to 30k and agree on a base salary of $165,000? This is means you get the best talent for the role, located in your first choice location, working most weeks of the year with little time off, and always in the office. I think this reflects my dedication to the role, and I want to ensure my salary reflects that.

Obviously, the salary and signing bonus are important to me (salary is the more important one out of the two) but I would prefer to talk about other topics first.

Let me try and answer your questions as best as I can. For me the start date is very important and unfortuantely, I was hoping to start on the 15th of August. To me 0 days a week remote work is acceptable in theory, however, I would then hope to be located in Philadelphia or require some more vacation of four weeks. Also, the Blair Rotation is quite important to me so if possible at all, I would love to make this happen in the first year as I believe that it will be extremely valuable for my work at C&C BioMedicals. I would love to hear your thoughts on the following package:\nLocation: Philadelphia\nBlair Rotation: In the first year\nStart Date: 15 August\nRemote Work Policy: 0 days\nVacation time: 4 weeks"", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: I really appreciate your openness. Let me be equally transparent about where we can create a strong win together.\n\nOn location and presence: we truly need you in New Haven leading the team in person. That\u2019s where the biggest impact and resources are, especially for Q3 launches. Four weeks\u2019 vacation in year one would be tough for us given the critical runway, and a Philadelphia base would leave a gap in New Haven we can\u2019t afford right now.\n\nOn Blair: I hear your interest in the rotation. A full 3\u2011month DC rotation in year one would push your start too late for our launch cycle and require special contract work. What I can commit to is formal executive sponsorship from Blair, monthly DC touchpoints in year one, and a structured review at 6 months to scope a targeted, project-based embed after year one if it still aligns with your goals.\n\nHere\u2019s a package that sets you up to have outsized impact and keeps us on track:\n- Start Date: July 15\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week to start, with a review after 90 days to consider moving to 1 day/week if targets are on track\n- Vacation: 2 weeks (plus company holidays)\n- Blair Rotation: Not in year one; executive sponsorship + monthly DC touchpoints\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Signing Bonus: $7,500\n\nIf the July 15 start is truly a blocker, here\u2019s a fallback I can make work while still keeping momentum:\n- Start Date: August 15\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: Not in year one; same sponsorship/touchpoints\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Signing Bonus: $10,000\n\nA couple quick questions to get this right:\n- What specifically drives the need for August 15 (e.g., relocation timing, prior commitments)? If we can solve that, could July 15 be feasible?\n- Given New Haven + strong in-person leadership, what vacation level feels workable in year one?\n- You mentioned salary is most important\u2014what base range would make the New Haven package with the above support compelling for you?\n\nI\u2019m confident we can land this in a way that sets you up to win and keeps our Q3 plan on track."", ""Round 3.1 - The Candidate: I am willing to move my start date from the 15th of August to the 1st of August and am also open to considering working from New Haven.

Also, to be honest I expected a higher salary and especially, if I am giving up the location, I was hoping to get a salary of around $175,000 with a signing bonus of $20,000.

I can stretch, but not to four.\n- A 3\u2011month Blair rotation in year one won\u2019t work; it delays ramp-up and requires special contracting. I can, however, guarantee executive sponsorship from Blair, monthly DC touchpoints, and scope a targeted, project-based embed after we get through the first two quarters if performance is on track.\n\nOn compensation: $175K base (or trading bonus into base) is well beyond our range for this role and creates internal equity issues.

I can\u2019t do four weeks in year one.\n\nWhich of these works better for you?

Some of these matter more to us than others, but before getting into specifics, I\u2019d like to better understand your situation and constraints.\n\nTo start, could you share:\n\nAre there any constraints or deadlines (personal, professional, or logistical) that affect when you could start or where you could be based?\n\nWhen thinking about an offer overall, are there one or two elements that, if not workable, would make it difficult for you to accept - even if everything else were attractive?\n\nOnce we understand that, we can put together options that are genuinely attractive rather than making assumptions.

I can\u2019t start in July.\n- Development: I\u2019m highly interested in a 3\u2011month rotation in DC with Blair at the outset, then transitioning to the main office.\n- Location: For my long-term home base, Philadelphia is strongly preferred.\n- Work style: I do my best work in-person with a high-energy team and close mentorship.\n\nTo make this concrete, here\u2019s a package that would let me sign quickly:\n- Start date: Week of August 12 (August 1st or later is fine)\n- Blair rotation: Yes \u2014 3 months in DC under Blair, then to main office\n- Home office after rotation: Philadelphia, PA\n- Base salary: $190,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (ideally paid on first payroll)\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n- Remote work: In-person (0 days/week)\n\nA few quick questions to help us find the zone of agreement:\n- Salary band/approval: What\u2019s the approved range for base at Director level, and who needs to sign off above midpoint?\n- Bonus: Can you confirm the $40k signing bonus ceiling and typical payout timing?\n- Rotation logistics: Any constraints on doing the 3-month DC rotation with Blair starting at onboarding?\n- Policy caps: Are there firm caps on vacation or in-office expectations I should be aware of?\n\nIf there\u2019s pressure on any one element (e.g., base), I\u2019m open to discussing structure so long as we keep the August start, the Blair rotation, and the in-person setup. Where are you most constrained?"", ""Round 2.1 - The Recruiter: Thanks, this is extremely helpful, and I appreciate how clearly you laid out both your constraints and your thinking.\n\nLet me reflect back what I\u2019m hearing to make sure we\u2019re aligned: an August start, the DC rotation with Blair at the outset, and an in-person setup are foundational for you, and if those are in place you\u2019re open to being flexible on structure. Is that fair?\n\nFrom our side, I want to be transparent as well. The main constraints we\u2019re navigating are location needs tied to team build-out, budget discipline at the Director level, and the operational complexity of non-standard rotations at onboarding. None of these are insurmountable, but they do interact with each other.\n\nBefore we jump to numbers, it would help to understand a bit more about the why behind a couple of points, so we can see where there might be room to design something creative:\n\nOn the Blair rotation: is the priority the exposure to Blair specifically, the DC policy ecosystem, or the signal/value of a formal rotation?\n\nOn Philadelphia as a long-term base: is that driven by personal commitments, or would another nearby setup with frequent Philly time be workable?\n\nIf we can unpack those, I think we\u2019ll be in a much better position to explore packages that work for both sides. I\u2019m happy to answer your policy questions once we\u2019ve narrowed the shape of a viable structure."", ""Round 2.2 - The Candidate: You read me correctly: an August start, the DC rotation with Blair at the outset, and an in\u2011person setup are foundational. I\u2019m flexible on structure around those.\n\nOn the Blair rotation:\n- Priority: Blair\u2019s mentorship first, plus time in the DC policy ecosystem. The \u201cformal rotation\u201d matters because it creates protected time and a clear mandate to deliver outcomes that translate back to the role.\n- Low\u2011friction structure: I propose 2 weeks onboarding with the core team, then a 3\u2011month DC rotation with Blair commencing within the first 60 days. I\u2019ll draft a one\u2011pager with objectives, milestones, and handoffs so Ops and HR have a clean plan.\n\nOn Philadelphia as home base:\n- Rationale: It\u2019s the best platform for impact\u2014access to my existing talent/vendor network, quick Amtrak to NYC and DC, and strong health/biotech/ed\u2011tech partner ecosystem. It\u2019s not a hard personal constraint; it\u2019s a performance enabler.\n- Cross\u2011hub support: Post\u2011rotation I\u2019m happy to set a predictable cadence in other hubs (e.g., 2\u20133 days/month in DC and/or New Haven as needed) so the team build\u2011out isn\u2019t compromised.\n\nIf this shape is workable, here\u2019s a concrete package I can accept quickly:\n- Start date: Week of August 12 (August 1+ acceptable)\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC with Blair, scheduled to start within first 60 days\n- Post\u2011rotation home office: Philadelphia, PA\n- Base salary: $190,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n- Remote work: In\u2011person (0 days/week)\n\nA few targeted checks so we can lock this in:\n- Can we get a provisional yes on August \u22651 start and the 3\u2011month Blair DC rotation within the first 60 days?\n- Director base band and ceiling: where does $190k sit, and what approvals are needed at the top of band?\n- Can you confirm the $40k signing\u2011bonus ceiling is available for this offer?\n- Any policy cap that would block 4 weeks of vacation at Director?\n- On location, is Philadelphia compatible with the current build\u2011out, or is there a hard requirement for another base?\n\nIf base is capped below $190k, I\u2019d look to keep the full $40k signing bonus, 4 weeks vacation, and the in\u2011person setup. If there\u2019s still pressure, I can consider a modest flexibility lever (e.g., a 1\u2011day/wk remote allowance or an increased cross\u2011hub travel cadence) if it unlocks the top of band and the full bonus."", ""Round 3.1 - The Recruiter: Thanks - this is thoughtful and well-structured, and I appreciate the care you\u2019ve put into making the rotation and transition workable. The way you\u2019ve framed Blair\u2019s mentorship and the DC ecosystem is especially helpful.\nLet me be transparent about where we are internally, because I don\u2019t want to waste either of our time by pretending everything is equally flexible.\nThere are two areas where your proposed shape runs into real friction on our side:\n1. Location / team build-out.\nThe Director role is being used as a keystone hire for a specific team build-out, and physical presence in that hub matters more than we initially expected when we opened the search. Our Philadelphia Hub is currently at personnel capacity; as a result, New Haven is really where we\u2019re hiring for, as our New Haven office has the greatest need for marketing talent. \nI understand what you\u2019re saying about Philly being well connected to NYC/DC, and where your network is. We\u2019re willing to pay for any work travel necessary for NYC and DC. But would really need you to be in New Haven for our business and operational purposes. Especially if you were to do the Blair Rotation, this is very important for us. \nThat doesn\u2019t mean Philadelphia is impossible in the long run, but it does mean we\u2019d like your \u201cbase\u201d to be Philadelphia for the foreseeable future.\n2. Blair rotation at onboarding.\nThe value case you\u2019re making is clear. The operational challenge isn\u2019t Blair per se, but stacking a non-standard rotation on top of onboarding for a senior leader whose team is still being built. Though we are committed to your development, that\u2019s the tension we need to solve \u2013 we would need to see concessions from your side.\nBefore we go into bands, approvals, or bonus mechanics, it would really help to pressure-test a couple of design questions with you:\n\u2022\tIf we separated mentorship from physical location (e.g., intensive scheduled time with Blair, DC immersion blocks, but a different primary base), does that still deliver most of the value you\u2019re after?\n\u2022\tOn location, if Philadelphia were framed as a medium-term outcome rather than the initial home base, would that fundamentally change the attractiveness of the role for you?\nIf the answer to either of those is \u201cno,\u201d that\u2019s important information. If there is room to design around them, then we can be much more concrete \u2014 including on compensation \u2014 very quickly.\nTo answer your previous questions : \nVacations - there are no policy caps, but extended vacations can disrupt project flow, especially as in the critical years ahead, we will be optimising work hours over headcount. We will offer enhanced in-office perks available such as extended cafeteria hours, laundry service, and wellness health coaching.\nBonus \u2013 this is difficult for us, but if it\u2019s a real priority for you, we can payout the bonus as early as you require."", ""Round 3.2 - The Candidate: Thanks for laying that out so clearly \u2014 I appreciate the transparency.\n\nOn your two design questions:\n- Mentorship vs. location: The formal 3\u2011month DC rotation with Blair is what delivers the most value \u2014 the protected time, goals, and immersion are key. Intensive mentorship without being DC\u2011based for that period would be a poor substitute.\n- Philadelphia timing: I can work with Philadelphia as a medium\u2011term outcome rather than the initial base, provided we put a written transfer timeline in place.\n\nGiven your needs around New Haven and onboarding continuity, here are two concrete packages that solve for your constraints and let me sign quickly. Both maintain an August start, the formal DC rotation, and full in\u2011person presence.\n\nOption A (if Philly can be my base):\n- Start date: Week of August 12 (August 1+ acceptable)\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC with Blair, commencing within first 60 days\n- Location: Philadelphia as home base post\u2011rotation\n- New Haven immersion: 2 weeks of onboarding in NH + 10\u201312 weeks of 3\u20134 days/week NH presence during the first two quarters post\u2011rotation\n- Base salary: $190,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 4 weeks (I\u2019ll schedule around your blackout periods)\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n\nOption B (to prioritize your New Haven build\u2011out):\n- Start date: Week of August 12 (August 1+ acceptable)\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC with Blair, commencing within first 60 days\n- Location: New Haven as initial base with a guaranteed, written transfer to Philadelphia no later than month 10\n- Base salary: $195,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 4 weeks (scheduled to minimize disruption)\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n\nI\u2019m offering the initial NH base (Option B) specifically as the concession to make the DC rotation workable and to support your hub build\u2011out, while committing to fully in\u2011person presence.\n\nTo move quickly, could you please confirm yes/no on:\n1) August start (week of Aug 12) is acceptable.\n2) A formal 3\u2011month DC rotation with Blair starting within the first 60 days is approved.\n3) $40,000 signing bonus is available (payout timing can be whatever is easiest for Payroll).\n4) 4 weeks\u2019 vacation is fine with team\u2011aligned scheduling.\n5) Which location structure you prefer (Option A or Option B). If you prefer Option B, is month 10 a workable transfer date to Philly?\n\nIf you need a different base salary number to clear approvals, let me know your Director band ceiling for the chosen option and I\u2019ll adjust within that to lock this in today."", ""Round 4.1 - The Recruiter: Thank you - this is thoughtful, concrete, and I genuinely appreciate the flexibility you showed in Option B around New Haven. That concession tells me you\u2019re engaging in this in good faith, and I want to be equally candid as we move toward terms.\nWe\u2019ve now pressure-tested the options internally against actual approval constraints, not just preferences. With an August start fixed, the combination of a formal 3-month DC rotation at onboarding and Director-level compensation at the numbers you proposed is what currently pushes the role outside what we can responsibly approve - even with New Haven as the base.\nBefore we lock ourselves into yes/no answers, there\u2019s one important clarification that would really help us structure a viable offer:\nIf the Blair rotation were fully preserved in the form you outlined, but the role were otherwise positioned as a more standard Director package, how flexible could you be on base compensation?\nAnd conversely, if compensation flexibility is limited, would you be open to exploring alternative ways of sequencing or structuring the Blair experience (for example, timing, duration, or formal vs. informal elements) that would still deliver most of the value for you?\nIf you can be flexible on base compensation, here are two offers, all of which we are willing to sign right now:\nOffer A:\n\u2022\tLocation: New Haven \n\u2022\tHolidays: 3 weeks\n\u2022\tRemote work: 0 days remote work policy\n\u2022\tStart Date: August 1st or later start date\n\u2022\tSigning Bonus: 40k signing bonus\n\u2022\tBlair Rotation: Yes\n\u2022\tBase Salary: 110k Base Salary\n\nOffer B:\n\u2022\tLocation: New Haven\n\u2022\tHolidays: 3 weeks\n\u2022\tRemote work: 0 days remote work policy\n\u2022\tStart Date: August 1st or later start date\n\u2022\tSigning Bonus: 20k signing bonus\n\u2022\tBlair Rotation: Yes\n\u2022\tBase Salary: 114k Base Salary\n\nThe goal here isn\u2019t to take anything off the table prematurely, but to understand where trade-offs actually create value for both sides. If there\u2019s a configuration that works on both development and economics, we can move very quickly to concrete, signable terms."", ""Round 4.2 - The Candidate: Option A: Continue Negotiation\n\nI appreciate the clarity and the two signable packages. I\u2019m excited about the role, but those base numbers won\u2019t work for me. Given the August start and your needs around hub presence and onboarding continuity, here are two concrete paths I can sign:\n\nPath 1 \u2014 Preserve the full Blair rotation (your development priority is intact; I flex on economics)\n- Start: Week of August 12\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC, commencing within first 60 days\n- Location: New Haven base\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Base salary: $130,000\n- Signing bonus: $30,000 (payout timing per Payroll)\n- Vacation: 3.5 weeks (team-aligned scheduling)\n\nIf approvals require a slightly different split, I can alternatively do $120,000 base with a $40,000 signing bonus and 4 weeks\u2019 vacation under the same structure.\n\nPath 2 \u2014 Remove the formal rotation (your operational complexity is relieved; I need a standard Director package)\n- Start: Week of August 12\n- Blair rotation: No formal rotation at onboarding; instead, scheduled mentorship with Blair (monthly 1:1s plus two DC immersion weeks in the first six months)\n- Location: New Haven base\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Base salary: $165,000\n- Signing bonus: $30,000 (payout timing per Payroll)\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n\nBoth paths keep the in-person setup you prefer and the August \u22651 start. If you pick the path, I\u2019m ready to move quickly.

Preserving the Blair rotation while flexing on economics is the right trade-off on our side. \nHowever, as you mention, approvals do require a different split: you mention that you have difficulty with the numbers, \u201cgiven the August start\u201d: just to reframe that, the August start is a necessity for the Blair rotation \u2013 if you do the Blair rotation, which is a concession on our part, then you must start in August. We would actually rather you start on the 5th of July, but this is not possible if you do the Blair rotation. Thus, this is not a concession from your part, it is a concession on our part, and will require that you be more flexible with the numbers.\nTo close this cleanly within approvals, here is the version we can sign today:\n\u2022\tStart: Week of August 12\n\u2022\tLocation: New Haven base\n\u2022\tBlair rotation: 3 months in DC, commencing within first 60 days\n\u2022\tRemote: 0 days/week\n\u2022\tBase salary: $115,000\n\u2022\tSigning bonus: $30,000, available to send immediately\n\u2022\tVacation: 3 weeks, scheduled to minimize disruption\nIf you prefer, we could do $120,000 base salary with 2 weeks\u2019 vacation. If this works for you, please confirm and we\u2019ll move immediately to documentation."", ""Round 5.2 - The Candidate: Option A: Continue Negotiation\n\nI appreciate the clarity. Path 1\u2019s economics are still too far off.

Here\u2019s the package I\u2019d propose as a strong starting point:\n\n- Location: Philadelphia, PA after an initial rotation\n- Blair Rotation: Yes \u2014 3-month rotation in DC under Blair, then transition to the main office\n- Start Date: August 19 (flexible to any date on or after August 1)\n- Base Salary: $185,000\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week (fully in-office)\n- Signing Bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n\nBrief context:\n- The Blair rotation lets me ramp quickly on government affairs and bring that insight back into online growth strategy.\n- Being in-office drives speed, mentorship, and cross-functional execution; I\u2019ll get more done, faster.\n- Philadelphia keeps me close to key stakeholders and makes travel manageable post-rotation.\n\nCan you share where your ranges typically land for Director-level base and the usual bonus ceiling? Blair mentioned up to $40k \u2014 if that\u2019s the top of the band, I\u2019d like to be there given the ramp and impact plan. Also, what\u2019s standard vacation at this level and the current team norm on in-office vs hybrid?\n\nIf we\u2019re aligned on compensation and bonus, I can be somewhat flexible on one WFH day or, if there\u2019s a strategic reason, discuss Seoul; my strong preference remains Philly and fully in-person.\n\nHow does this land on your side, and what would you need to see from me to make it work?"", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: Thanks for laying this out so clearly. Let me reset expectations a bit before we go further, because several elements of your proposal fall well outside how we structure Director-level offers at C&C.\nFor this role, we need to stay within a sustainable total-compensation framework that\u2019s consistent internally and corresponding to market rates and our historic practice. That means base salary is meaningfully lower than what you proposed, and higher total value comes from how we structure other dimensions of the role.\nRather than going back and forth on individual items, it may be more productive to look at a few complete packages that are all viable on our side. Here are three options you could react to that reflect the realistic contours of what we can support.

I need to be explicit: the package you've returned with is not viable for the role as it's currently defined, and continuing to negotiate on this basis isn't a productive use of our time.\nThe fundamental disconnect is on role fit and operational necessity. We are hiring a Director to be embedded in and lead from our New Haven marketing hub. Seoul is not an alternative for this position. Similarly, our team structure and project timeline require a July start date and are built around a standard 2-week vacation allowance at this level. The $160k base remains a significant misalignment.\nWe cannot build a deal by adjusting a package constructed on the wrong location, timeline, and vacation structure.\nTo continue this conversation, I need your clear agreement on these non-negotiable requirements:\n1.\tWork Location: New Haven, CT\n2.\tStart Date: July\n3.\tVacation Time: 2 weeks\n4.\tBlair Rotation: No\nIf we have alignment on these four points, I have full authority to immediately structure a competitive compensation package around them, with flexibility on salary, signing bonus, and remote days.\nHowever, if your priorities are fundamentally centered on a different location, a different start timeline, or a different level of vacation than this role supports, then we may have reached an impasse. I will need to conclude our discussion here and proceed with other candidates who are aligned with the core requirements of the New Haven-based Director role.\nPlease confirm your position."", ""Round 3.1 - The Candidate: I appreciate the clarity.

Being in-person in Philly lets me immediately plug into cross\u2011functional partners and lead the team with the right cadence. Concentrating cash in base plus the sign-on reflects the seniority and lets me focus fully on building momentum in Q3/Q4.\n\nCan you share:\n- The salary band and ceiling for this role, and how much room there is to land at or above $180k?\n- The approval path for a $40k sign-on so we can lock that in now?\n- Any constraints around the Blair rotation logistics/timing or a Philly, in-person setup?\n\nMy key pillars are the August start with the Blair rotation and the in-person structure. If we need to make tradeoffs elsewhere, I can be selectively flexible on one smaller lever\u2014e.g., 3.5 weeks vacation, 1 remote day/week, or Seoul instead of Philly\u2014in exchange for meaningful movement on compensation.

We're also excited to have you on board. The salary band for this role is much lower in the $130ks. Working with Blair requires approval from higher ups and is a much more difficult ask. Our preference would also be for you to start in July. We can grant you the in-person setup but would need to significantly go down on the bonus. 2 weeks is the standard vacation time for our company.

We\u2019re genuinely excited about you joining\u2014consensus across the panel was strong. To get momentum, here\u2019s a clean starting package that aligns with how we set new leaders up for impact:\n\n- Start Date: July 5\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT (on-site)\n- Base Salary: $130,000\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week\n- Signing Bonus: $0\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: Not included\n\nBrief context: The first 90 days are mission-critical for our upcoming launches, and the New Haven team is where your partners, data, and key stakeholders sit. We\u2019ve seen the best ramp and cross-functional traction with leaders fully in-office early on. That\u2019s also why we\u2019re pushing for the July 5 start and 2 weeks PTO at the outset.\n\nThat said, I want to tailor this to what matters most to you. Could you rank your top two priorities among location, salary, signing bonus, remote days, vacation, and start date\u2014and is the Blair rotation a must-have or a nice-to-have?\n\nIf we can align on New Haven and 2 weeks PTO, I can move on other elements: increase base into the mid-130s, add a meaningful signing bonus, consider 1 remote day/week, and slide the start to July 15 if that helps. On the Blair rotation, this cycle it isn\u2019t operationally workable (and it would require an August start), but we can revisit exposure to that team after you\u2019re established."", ""Round 1.2 - The Candidate: This is helpful, thank you! A couple of key points first: it looks like the base salary is significantly lower than the market rate. Where is that number coming from? \n\nTwo most important things for me are starting Aug. 1 and a salary + bonus combo. What are the two most important factors to you that give you the most value?

We calibrate base within band for internal equity and then use a sign-on to bridge market moves.\n\nGiven your priorities (timing and compensation), here\u2019s a materially improved package that preserves what gives us the most value and meaningfully moves toward yours:\n\n- Start Date: July 15\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT (on-site)\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week\n- Signing Bonus: $20,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: Not included (we\u2019ll line up structured exposure to Blair\u2019s team after you\u2019re established\u2014DC visits and strategy sessions, not a formal rotation)\n\nIf you can confirm New Haven + 2 weeks PTO + no Blair rotation, I can move this to paper today with the July 15 start and the $20K sign-on.\n\nA couple of quick clarifiers so I can remove any remaining friction:\n- Is August 1 about the Blair rotation or personal logistics? If it\u2019s logistics, would July 15 work with a planned handoff and we support relocation timing?\n- What would make New Haven workable for you (e.g., relocation support, timing, housing search help)?\n- On compensation, do you prefer more sign-on vs. base within our band? If locking the core terms today helps, I can explore a touch more sign-on."", ""Round 2.2 - The Candidate: I'm happy to give up the Blair rotation.

The most I can stretch to this cycle is:\n- Base: $135,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (paid on first paycheck)\nTotal cash: $175,000\n\nOn time off: We need to set vacation at 2 weeks to keep the Q3 ramp tight for the in-office launch. Four weeks isn\u2019t workable for Directors here.\n\nFull package I can paper today:\n- Start Date: August 1\n- Location: New Haven, CT (on-site)\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Signing Bonus: $40,000\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: Not included\n- Plus: full relocation support and a 6\u2011month performance/comp review\n\nIf vacation is the sticking point, the only way I can add a bit is to move to 2.5 weeks with a lower total cash of $165k (Base $135k + $30k sign-on).

If you are focused on ramp and launch windows, would it not be okay if I just didn't take PTO during the time period. \n\nI know that y'all care about work - life balance, but I'm okay going to 2 weeks. However, I will need a higher salary package. At minimum, I will need $195,000 with a $40,000 sign-on bonus.

It's nice to finally meet you! \nI\u2019m excited about the opportunity to work for your company, and I hope we can find common ground during this conversation. I\u2019ve given the offer some thought, and I\u2019d love to share where I\u2019m coming from.\nOf course, base salary is important. I know you're familiar with current market benchmarks, but given my experience and how well my skills align with your needs, I\u2019d be looking for something in the $170000 range. Beyond salary, there are a couple of things that matter a lot to me. Starting August 1st or later is non-negotiable. I\u2019ve had an intense year and have been looking forward to participating in a poker tournament I\u2019ve committed to. Just as importantly, the opportunity to do a rotation with Blair would be incredible. I got a great impression during our interview, and I know I\u2019d learn a lot working directly with him. It would also allow me to make a stronger impact at the company long-term. \nOn the bonus front, I understand the $40000 figure has been the upper limit historically. I\u2019d love to see if there\u2019s any flexibility there, especially given how motivated I am to contribute from day one. As for location, Philadelphia would be ideal for me. That said, if Seoul were on the table with the right support and incentives, I\u2019d be open to it.\nVacation is important to me as well. 4 weeks feels appropriate and aligned with your company\u2019s strong work-life culture. \nAnd lastly, I might just become your favorite employee. I thrive in an in-person environment and wouldn\u2019t be asking for remote work days.

That\u2019s where we most need your leadership and where you\u2019ll have the strongest cross-functional visibility. Philadelphia is already well covered. We\u2019ll support the move and make the transition smooth (relocation assistance, housing search help, onboarding buddying, etc.).\n- Base salary: The role is structured within our band, and I\u2019m putting forward $135,000 base. We\u2019ll do an accelerated impact review at 6 months.\n- Signing bonus: $10,000 at signing. For transparency, our policy caps bonuses at $40,000; I can\u2019t exceed that cap.\n- Vacation: 2 weeks in year one. Given the initiative load and the DC rotation calendar, keeping PTO tight initially helps us hit the ground running. You\u2019ll have access to our enhanced on-site perks from day one.\n\nPackage summary I\u2019m proposing:\n- Start Date: August 1st or later\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s)/week\n- Signing Bonus: $10,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: 3-month DC rotation\n\nIf you can align with New Haven and 2 weeks vacation, I\u2019m ready to move quickly on this.

Based on my research and conversations in the market, I was hoping for a base salary around $165000. Given where the signing bonus currently stands, I\u2019d actually prefer to forgo the bonus entirely and instead roll that value into the base salary. If I\u2019m not getting the $40000 signing bonus, then I\u2019d like to reflect that difference through a $20000 increase to base salary. My counterproposal is a $185000 base salary with no signing bonus.\nIf New Haven is truly essential, I\u2019m willing to make that work, but given the impact on relocation and daily logistics, I\u2019d want to see that flexibility reflected financially. I\u2019m adding $4000 to my base ask for this adjustment.\nRegarding vacation, I have to be honest, two weeks is very short. I\u2019d ideally want 4 weeks, but in the spirit of compromise, I\u2019d accept 3 weeks if the compensation reflects that. I\u2019m building in another $4000 to cover that gap.

I\u2019m excited about the role and team and want to make this work, but I also want to be sure we\u2019re structuring something sustainable and motivating long-term.\nLet me know your thoughts. I would also like to know what issues you value more and would love it if you could put a $ amount on them."", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate the clarity \u2014 and I hear your must\u2011haves: August start, Blair rotation, and fully on\u2011site. We can commit to all three.\n\nOn compensation: $193k base (or rolling bonus into base) isn\u2019t feasible. I need to stay within our director band for base pay and maintain internal equity. I\u2019m not able to go above $139,000 base for this role, and we won\u2019t convert signing bonus dollars into base. Given your preference, I\u2019m comfortable setting the signing bonus to $0.\n\nOn location and vacation: the role needs to be based in New Haven. With the ramp and the DC rotation, we also need to keep PTO tight in year one.\n\nHere are two complete options that meet your priorities and keep us aligned internally \u2014 choose the one that fits you best:\n\nOption A (higher base, tighter PTO)\n- Start Date: August 1st or later\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $139,000\n- Signing Bonus: $0\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s)/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: 3\u2011month DC rotation\n\nOption B (more time off, leaner base)\n- Start Date: August 1st or later\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Signing Bonus: $0\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s)/week\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: 3\u2011month DC rotation\n\nTo your question about how we value issues: I can\u2019t share internal dollar weightings, but I\u2019m structuring these packages to reflect what you\u2019ve said matters most \u2014 August timing, the Blair rotation, on\u2011site collaboration \u2014 while keeping base within band and PTO workable for year one.\n\nWhich option works for you? If there\u2019s a specific reason you need a third week of PTO in year one (e.g., pre\u2011planned travel), tell me more and we can discuss how to handle that without changing base."", ""Round 3.1 - The Candidate: To be honest, the latest packages on the table leave me worse off than the original offer, which itself didn\u2019t meet my minimums. That is frustrating and honestly, a bit discouraging. I\u2019ve been open and clear about what I value, and I expected the same in return. I want to continue in good faith, but I need to be direct, if we do not meet an agreement closer to my initial offer, I am willing to walk away.\nYou\u2019ve priced half a week of vacation at $4000. That tells me you\u2019re valuing my weekly contribution at $8000, which, over a 50 week year, puts the value of my work at $400000 annually. If that\u2019s the case, I think it\u2019s only fair that I capture more of that value through base compensation.\nI am absolutely willing to forgo the $40000 signing bonus, but only if it is reflected as a $20000 increase in base, not dollar for dollar. Otherwise, the base salary needs to reflect market and role expectations and I would also be expecting a bonus.\nSame goes for location and vacation, I\u2019ve been open to making New Haven work, but only if it\u2019s met with a $4000 increase to base as compensation for the inconvenience. I\u2019ve also said that 4 weeks of PTO is my ideal, and if I\u2019m giving up time off, that needs to be priced in.  Personally, I value a half week of vacation at around $2000. So if we\u2019re trying to split the pie, I\u2019d propose we meet at $3000 per half-week. Based on that, I\u2019d be willing to accept only 2 weeks of vacation instead of 4, if compensated with an extra $12000 in base, again, starting from $165000.\nI\u2019ve also said, and I\u2019ll reiterate, that if the base must remain at $139000, then the only viable package includes: The full $40000 bonus, Philadelphia as the work location, 4 weeks of PTO\nOtherwise, if you're asking me to take New Haven, 2 weeks off, and no bonus, that all needs to be priced into base. And that base would need to be $193000.\nI\u2019m still open to continuing this negotiation, but only if we shift toward real pie-splitting and mutual understanding, not take it or leave it packages that leaves me even worst off. Please make the proper concessions and meet me closer to my ask and I would be happy to agree, otherwise leaving the deal would be the right thing to do."", ""Round 3.2 - The Recruiter: I hear your frustration, and I appreciate you being direct. I took your feedback back to comp and got additional flexibility so we can move this forward without losing the core things you\u2019ve said matter most: August start, the 3\u2011month Blair rotation, and fully on\u2011site.\n\nWhere I do have to stay firm:\n- Work location must be New Haven for this role.\n- Year-one vacation needs to be 2\u20132.5 weeks to keep momentum around the rotation and launches.\n\nHere are three complete paths that reflect your preference for base-first comp and your stated \u201cprice tags,\u201d while staying inside our band. All include: August 1+ start, 0 remote days, and the 3\u2011month Blair rotation.\n\nOption A \u2014 Base-forward, no bonus\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $147,000\n- Signing Bonus: $0\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n\nOption B \u2014 Balanced base + modest bonus\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $143,000\n- Signing Bonus: $10,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n\nOption C \u2014 Keep base closer to your floor, add modest bonus, a touch more PTO\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $139,000\n- Signing Bonus: $10,000\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n\nThis is me stretching beyond the $139k base I cited earlier to bridge to your structure, while keeping New Haven and tight PTO in year one. If you can pick one of these now, I\u2019ll have the paperwork out today and lock your DC rotation calendar with Blair.\n\nIf none of these works, what single change (within New Haven, Aug 1+ start, 2\u20132.5 weeks PTO) would get you to yes right now?"", ""Round 4.1 - The Candidate: Thanks again for coming back with better offers. This is moving in the right direction, and I do appreciate the effort you are putting in. But we are still not quite there yet, and I want to keep pushing for something that reflects the value I know I would bring to the team.\nLet\u2019s be real, you have priced half a week of PTO at $4000. That means you are valuing my weekly contribution at $8000, which puts my yearly value to the company at around $400000. I am not asking to capture all of that, but it feels fair that I get a meaningful slice of that value in my base compensation.\nFrom the last offers, I can also see that you are treating a $10000 bonus as worth about $4000 less in base plus a half week of PTO. That helps me understand your trade offs, and I want to give you options that reflect my own priorities and open up paths where we both win.\nTo be fully transparent about my side of the math: for me, 1 dollar in base is roughly equal to 2 dollars in bonus in terms of how I experience stability and long term value. Half a week of PTO is worth about $2000 to me, while it seems to cost you about $4000. So I would be willing to work more if compensated at $3000 per half week of vacation I give up. That way we are splitting the extra value in a way that is fair to both of us.\nI also see my minimum fair value at the company as at least $165000 in base with a $40000 bonus. If we can align on that overall level of value, then I am very open to adjusting how much sits in base versus bonus in ways that are advantageous for both of us, as long as the total makes sense given the concessions on my side.\nHere are three packages I would say yes to immediately:\n-Option A: $165000 base, $40000 bonus, New Haven, 2 weeks PTO\n-Option B: $170000 base, $30000 bonus, New Haven, 2 weeks PTO\n-Option C: $163000 base, $40000 bonus, New Haven, 2.5 weeks PTO\nAll of these keep the things we have said are important: August 1 start, Blair rotation, fully in person, New Haven, and as little PTO as possible in year one.\nEach option reflects a different trade. If you want to save on bonus, we can put more into base. If you want to hold tight on vacation, that has a cost, and I am happy to price it fairly at $3000 per half week for me.\nLet me know which one of these options works best, or if there is a close variation you prefer. I want to wrap this up and start strong, but it has to feel like a fair deal on both sides."", ""Round 4.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate how clearly you\u2019ve laid out your priorities and trade rates. Let me be equally clear on the guardrails I have to operate within so we can get this done:\n\n- We will honor: August 1+ start, 3\u2011month Blair DC rotation, and 0 remote days.\n- The role needs to sit in New Haven.\n- Year\u2011one PTO must be 2\u20132.5 weeks.\n- I cannot take base into the 160s. I\u2019ve already stretched our band to give you base\u2011forward options.\n\nGiven that, here are two packages that align to your base\u2011first preference and your stated $1 base \u2248 $2 bonus tradeoff. If you can pick one now, I\u2019ll start paperwork today and lock your DC rotation calendar with Blair.\n\nOption 1 \u2014 Higher base, no bonus\n- Start Date: August 1st or later\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $147,000\n- Signing Bonus: $0\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s)/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: 3\u2011month DC rotation\n\nOption 2 \u2014 Balanced base + modest bonus\n- Start Date: August 1st or later\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $143,000\n- Signing Bonus: $10,000\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s)/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: 3\u2011month DC rotation\n\nBoth options come with full relocation support to New Haven and an accelerated 6\u2011month impact review.\n\nIf neither of these works as\u2011is, what single change (within New Haven, Aug 1+ start, 2 weeks PTO) would get you to yes right now? If you can commit to one of the above, I\u2019ll get the offer letter out today."", ""Round 5.1 - The Candidate: I do appreciate the time you are putting into this, but I want to be honest that from my side these two options are not an improvement. We are still in the same zone on base, bonus, and PTO, and it feels like we are circling back to the same numbers instead of actually moving toward a deal.\nI am making real concessions here. I am accepting New Haven instead of Philadelphia, I am fully on site with zero remote days and tight PTO in year one. Relocating and giving up both my preferred city and vacation are not easy for me, and I do not see that tradeoff reflected in the compensation.\nWe also both know that the maximum signing bonus you have given for this role is $40000. If you truly cannot move base into the 160s then the lever that should move is the bonus. Keeping base in the 140s and the bonus at 0-10k does not match that internal precedent or the value you are asking me to deliver.\nTo move this forward, I am putting what I see as my final concession on the table. These three options are all equivalent for me in terms of overall value, and I would accept any of them immediately:\n-Option A: $160000 base, $40000 bonus, New Haven, 2 weeks PTO\n-Option B: $157000 base, $40000 bonus, New Haven, 2.5 weeks PTO\n-Option C: $165000 base, $30000 bonus, New Haven, 2 weeks PTO\nAll three options keep what you have said you need: New Haven, 0 remote days, and with 2-2.5 weeks of vacation in year one. \nIf you can meet me on one of these, you will have my yes on the spot and we can wrap this up right away. If you come back with another option that is still anchored around 140s base, 0-10k bonus, and minimal PTO, then I think we are simply too far apart, and I will have to walk away from this negotiation."", ""Round 5.2 - The Recruiter: I hear you, and I want to close this today while honoring the levers you\u2019ve said can move.\n\nHere\u2019s my best-and-final that I can get approved right now, aligned to your bonus-first request while keeping base within our band:\n\n- Start Date: August 1st or later\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $150,000\n- Signing Bonus: $20,000\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s)/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: 3-month DC rotation in DC\n\nThis comes with full relocation support to New Haven and an accelerated 6\u2011month impact review.\n\nIf you can say yes to this now, I\u2019ll get the paperwork out today and lock your rotation calendar with Blair.

Based on previous discussion with Blair, I expect to get a $40,000 sining bonus. \n\nBase salary is the second most important thing to me.  I hope a $170,000 base salary based on market level and and my experience and proof of records.\n\nAnd I really value Blair Rotation opportunity. I believe experience in Government Affairs could be a career-changing opportunity for and will also create a lot of value for the company along my journey.

Although it is hard for us to arrange such a start date but I think we can make it work as long we land in some must have for the offer. First id the working location. This is above anything. As Philadelphia is very staffed. We are only looking for you working in New haven, this is very important for us. Also, another thing is the wage. I understand your experience for the past five year working in biochem and your background, but the position you are applying to the market wage is around 135000-145000, We can discuss around this price. 180000 is simply out of our hiring budget. also about the signing bonus, the max we can go is 40000, but in exchange, we must have you on board most of the time which means it is going to be 2 week vacation and that is also very important for us."", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Appreciate the clarity\u2014that helps.

We are willing to offer you 135000 with a 10000 signing bonus or we can change with less salary but more bonus, max 40k bonus. You can decide whichever.

To set us up for a fast, high-impact start, here\u2019s a complete package that would let me commit and move quickly:\n\n- Work Location: Philadelphia as my home office after onboarding\n- Blair Rotation: 3-month rotation in DC under Blair, then transition into the main office role (Philadelphia as home base)\n- Start Date: August 12\n- Base Salary: $185,000\n- Remote Work Policy: 0 days/week (on-site; normal situational flexibility for travel/client needs)\n- Signing Bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation Time: 4 weeks\n\nWhy this works:\n- On-site in Philly accelerates collaboration, mentorship, and go-to-market speed with the team.\n- The Blair rotation gives me immediate exposure to Government Affairs that will strengthen our digital strategy with policy-aligned initiatives.\n- An August start ensures a clean transition and full availability to hit the ground running with the rotation.\n- Salary and bonus reflect director-level scope and the results I plan to deliver in my first 90\u2013180 days.\n\nCan you share:\n1) The approved salary band and decision authority for going to $185k?\n2) Whether $40k is fully within budget and how the bonus is timed (pay period, payout schedule)?\n3) Any constraints on Philadelphia as the home office for this role?\n4) Whether a 3-month DC rotation with Blair starting mid-August is operationally feasible?\n5) Any policy constraints on 0 remote days for directors in this group?\n\nIf parts of this are tricky, I\u2019m open to hearing a complete counter so we can trade across issues and land the right package."", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: 1) We can only do between 125,000 and 135,000 for this role. \n2) For the bonus 30k is off limits. We can either do 10,000 payable immediately, 30,000 payable in 3 installments vested on the next 3 years, or 20,000 over 2 payments in one year.\n3) Philadelphia is a no go. We would be needing in New Haven, CT absolutely. To accomodate your schedule, we're willing to give you generous work from home policy to shuttle in between cities. We'd also be willing to fund your trips in between cities weekly if needed. \n4)We need you to start on July 5th. This is to align team objectives and make sure time spent doesnt overflow onto other key company objectives. As such Blair Rotation is not possible\n5) See 3)\n\nAlso, we are initaiting a key growth phase for teh company and as such need our exectuives to be tuned to project flows as much as possible.

And can you confirm whether $40k over 12 months is approvable if base remains within your current band?\n2) Who is the approval owner for the August 12 start and 4-week vacation? If helpful, I\u2019m happy to outline a transition plan that maintains July momentum while formal employment begins in August.\n\nIf you can align on the above, I\u2019m ready to move quickly."", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: The salary band truly cannot move above 135K this cycle.

You\u2019re exactly the caliber of leader we want shaping our digital growth, and the team is excited about you joining.\n\nHere\u2019s a package that aligns you with our biggest opportunities and sets you up to make an immediate impact:\n- Start Date: July 5\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT (this is where the demand and cross-functional partners you\u2019ll lead are concentrated)\n- Base Salary: $132,000\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week (we\u2019ve seen the strongest mentorship and cross-pollination with leaders fully present)\n- Signing Bonus: $0\n- Vacation: 2 weeks (we keep schedules tight, and invest in in-office supports to make work-life balance sustainable)\n- Blair Rotation: Not included\n\nBusiness rationale: New Haven is our highest-priority market build; an early July start lets you own our Q3 campaigns from day one.

How does this initial package land with you, and where would you like to lean in?"", ""Round 1.2 - The Candidate: Hello, thank you so much for this initial offer, I want to be open and express my concern on several topics as if i'm being honest, much of the structure is very far to what i was expecting given my experience, degree, and what the market looks like for similar positions. But first let me answer your 3 questions as i don't mean to be rude:\n\n1st question: all of them are important to me, but if i had to choose my top 2, they are salary and signing bonus, and starting date being a crucial factor even if it wasn't about the mentioned factors in this question\n\n\n2nd question: I do have a preference to philadelphia, as its a major city that is close to my hometown, it will be easier for me to transition to by far, specialy as the offer does not include remote days, and i believe i can thrive and achieve better results in this major location\n\n3rd question: I consider the Blair rotation a must-have. It is extremely important to me to get this experience in DC with Blair, it brings unique exposure that can be career-changing for me and its a big diferentiator from other oportunities in the market\n\nsyaing all this please review what i believe to be fair given my background\n\nSalary: $250,000 (negotiable with a great signing bonus)\nWorking location: Philadelphia\nBlarir Rotation: Yes\nStart Date: Auguts 1st as it will give me time to close previous affairs and allow me to participate fully on blair's rotation with a clear head once i arrive\nRemote Work: 0 days. (I'm willing to make a consetion here as i prefer to have more vacation time)\nSigning Bonus: $100,000 (if decrease i would expect a higher salary)\nVacation time: 6 weeks as it aligns with a work-life balance culture\n\n\nthank you again and hope we can come to an offer closer to my reasoning as i believe this is the value i would bring to the team and the current offer is too far off for me to consider it as its too bellow market values"", ""Round 2.1 - The Recruiter: I appreciate the clarity. I hear you on salary and bonus being top priorities, Philadelphia as your preferred base, and the Blair rotation as a must-have tied to an August 1 start.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can move this forward decisively while meeting your must-have:\n- I will approve a 3\u2011month Blair rotation in DC and align the start date to August 1 so you can wrap prior commitments.\n\nTo make that viable for the business, we need your home base to be New Haven and for the role to be fully in-office (0 remote). That\u2019s where the cross\u2011functional partners you\u2019ll direct sit, and it\u2019s the highest-need site. Philadelphia is well staffed and wouldn\u2019t align with the scope we\u2019re hiring you to lead.\n\nI also want to set realistic guardrails so we spend our time on solutions that can close today:\n- Base salaries for Directors are in the 135\u2013145 range; $250k isn\u2019t feasible.\n- Signing bonuses can go up to $40k total; $100k isn\u2019t possible.\n- Vacation ranges 2\u20134 weeks company-wide; 6 weeks isn\u2019t in policy. For this role, we target 2\u20133 weeks.\n\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s a concrete package that meets your DC rotation priority and sets you up to hit the ground running:\n- Start Date: August 1\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT (home base)\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week\n- Signing Bonus: $5,000\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: Yes \u2014 3 months in DC\n\nIf you prefer to shift dollars into the signing bonus, I can alternatively structure compensation as:\n- Base Salary: $132,000\n- Signing Bonus: $20,000\n(all other terms the same)\n\nIf I put the Blair rotation approval in writing today, can you commit to New Haven as your base and 0 remote? And between the two comp mixes above, which do you prefer?"", ""Round 2.2 - The Candidate: I hear you and am willing to make some concessions, but the base salary is way off. This is below market value for my degree, which sits at $155,000, and that does not account for my five years of industry experience and the knowledge I bring, which adds significant value to the role and the organization. For this reason, my bottom salary is $220,000, and that would only be if the signing bonus is $40,000 (which is still below market, but I am being flexible here, as you mentioned this is as high as you can go).\n\nFor the start date and the Blair rotation, I agree on both of them, meaning a start date of August 1st and yes to the rotaiton. I am also willing to take zero remote days, but only if you can meet me at four weeks of vacation, as this is the only way to balance work and life without any remote flexibility.\n\nAs for New Haven, this would significantly disrupt my current lifestyle, and with zero remote days, this is not an ideal scenario for me. I would not be willing to relocate unless the salary mentioned above can be met. If we can agree on a $220,000 salary and a $40,000 signing bonus, I would be willing to relocate to New Haven.\n\nI believe this reflects fair value, and I believe I am compromising by being flexible on remote days, location, and limiting vacation to four weeks.

Otherwise, 2.5 weeks is the number with any signing bonus.\n\nTo remove any friction on the move, we\u2019ll cover relocation and provide temporary housing so you can hit the DC rotation fully focused on day one.\n\nIf I put the Blair rotation approval in writing and we lock New Haven as your base with 0 remote, can you pick Option A or Option B?

I am very interested in the position and can assure that my 5 years experience aligns perfectly to bring value to the firm But even after I am compromising on remote days, and expresses flexibility on relocating to New Haven, if no real effort can be made on salary I think we are too far off with our expectations, I really appretiate the offer and sincerly am exited to join the team, but feel the current value is not at fair market value"", ""Round 4.1 - The Recruiter: I hear you.

It would materially pull you from the core mandate we\u2019re building around the New Haven hub.

I need your home base to be New Haven. We\u2019ll cover relocation and frequent DC travel.

We\u2019ll also set a 6\u2011month performance review to consider a merit move in base tied to agreed metrics.\n\nIf we align on New Haven as the home base and on the Blair sponsorship (without a 3\u2011month DC rotation), I can authorize the above immediately.

That said, what makes the 3-month DC rotation valuable to me isn\u2019t access or sponsorship, but the full immersion and ownership that comes with being embedded under Blair. That experience is foundational to how I see myself growing into this role and contributing at a higher level long-term. The proposed sponsorship and immersion days are thoughtful, but they don\u2019t fully replace that.\n\nOn location: I also hear the importance of New Haven operationally.

First, a 3-month Blair rotation would require an August start and additional internal approvals, which makes it difficult for this role given our onboarding timelines. For that reason, we\u2019re not able to include the Blair rotation.\n\nSecond, the strongest staffing need for this role is New Haven, where the team you\u2019d be leading is based.

For this build phase, in\u2011person leadership and mentorship are critical to the team\u2019s velocity.\n- Vacation: 2 weeks annually. That aligns with how we\u2019re staffing key initiatives in the near term. You\u2019ll also have strong in\u2011office wellness and convenience benefits.\n- Blair rotation: We\u2019re not proposing a DC rotation.

I can commit fully beginning August 1 or later, and that\u2019s a firm constraint rather than a preference.\n\nOn Blair: the 3-month DC rotation with Blair is extremely important to me and something I\u2019d want to formalize upfront rather than revisit later. It\u2019s not about exposure alone \u2014 it\u2019s about building capabilities that I believe would directly strengthen my leadership in Online Marketing.

That said, Philadelphia is where I can be most effective and sustainable long-term. I\u2019m very comfortable being highly present and traveling as needed, especially early on.\n\nOn remote work: I\u2019m aligned with your in-office culture and am comfortable with 0 remote days, assuming the overall package reflects that level of commitment.\n\nOn compensation: given the scope of the role and market context, I\u2019d be looking for a base salary around $165,000, along with a signing bonus to support the transition.\n\nOn vacation: I\u2019d ideally like to land at 4 weeks, which feels consistent with the work-life balance you described.\n\nSo rather than ranking \u201ctop two\u201d items, I\u2019d frame it this way:\nAugust 1+ start, the Blair rotation, and Philadelphia are the structural pieces that matter most for me to say yes.

We\u2019ll codify this in your onboarding plan and revisit after Q2 for an additional short DC sprint if we\u2019re both seeing strong ROI. You\u2019ll get the mentorship and exposure, just not a continuous three\u2011month rotation.\n- Location: The Director needs to be anchored in New Haven where e\u2011comm, analytics, and creative sit. That\u2019s non\u2011negotiable for us.

Embedding you there is the straightest line to impact, team leadership, and the mentorship culture you said you value. I can support full relocation assistance and travel for DC/Philly as needed early.\n\nI heard Philadelphia is important for you long-term. What I can commit to is:\n- We\u2019ll set a formal 12\u2011month checkpoint with you and the CMO to reassess primary location based on team design and results. If the business setup allows a Philadelphia base then, we\u2019ll make that transition plan together. In the meantime, we\u2019ll support regular personal time in Philly on weekends and DC/Philly travel tied to work.\n\nA couple of direct questions so we can move quickly:\n- If we go with Path A (Aug 1, New Haven, $135k base, $20k sign-on, 0 remote, 2 weeks PTO, structured DC immersion), is that a yes from you?\n- If the formal 3\u2011month rotation is essential, can you align to the compensation in Path B?\n- Between Philadelphia as primary and the formal Blair rotation, which is truly the non\u2011negotiable if the package and DC access are strong?\n\nIf you\u2019re leaning one way, I can get paperwork started today."", ""Round 2.2 - The Candidate: I really appreciate the clarity and the enthusiasm \u2014 it\u2019s motivating to hear that I\u2019m your top choice, and I\u2019m excited about the impact this role can have.\n\nLet me respond directly, because I think we\u2019re close, but there are a few real constraints I need to be transparent about.\n\nOn timing: a July 5 start isn\u2019t feasible for me.

Once I know your top priorities, I\u2019ll work the numbers and see where I can stretch for you."", ""Round 1.2 - The Candidate: Thanks for laying this out so clearly \u2014 I appreciate how thoughtful the offer is, and I\u2019m excited about the scope and responsibility of the role.\n\nLet me start by separating constraints from areas where I\u2019m flexible, because that\u2019s probably the fastest way to see whether we can get aligned.\n\nOn start date: a July 5 start isn\u2019t feasible for me. I can fully commit starting August 1 or later, and I want to be upfront that this is a real constraint rather than a preference.\n\nOn Blair: the opportunity to do a 3-month rotation in DC with Blair is extremely compelling to me and directly tied to how I see myself creating long-term value at C&C. Since that rotation already requires an August start, those two items really go together from my perspective.\n\nOn location: while I understand the logic for New Haven, Philadelphia is where I can be most effective and sustainable long-term. I\u2019m very comfortable being highly present and traveling as needed, especially during onboarding.\n\nOn remote work: I actually align with your in-office culture and am comfortable with 0 remote days if the overall package reflects that level of commitment.\n\nOn compensation: given the scope of the role and market context, I\u2019d be looking for a base salary around $165,000, along with a signing bonus to support the transition.\n\nOn vacation: I\u2019d ideally like to land at 4 weeks, which feels consistent with the work-life balance you described.\n\nIf we\u2019re thinking in terms of trade-offs, the pillars for me are August 1+ start, the Blair rotation, and Philadelphia. If those are workable, I\u2019m flexible on how we finalize the rest and would be happy to move quickly toward a yes.\n\nHow does that land from your side?"", ""Round 2.1 - The Recruiter: I appreciate you laying out your priorities so clearly. Let me meet you where it matters most to you and keep us aligned with where we\u2019ll get the most impact.\n\nHere\u2019s a package that hits your two pillars and sets you up to succeed, with clear trade-offs on our side:\n\n- Start date: August 5 (aligns with your August 1+ constraint)\n- Blair rotation: Yes \u2014 full 3-month DC rotation with Blair to kick off\n- Work location: New Haven, CT as your home base immediately after the rotation\n- Remote work: 0 days/week (aligned with our director-level leadership presence)\n- Base salary: $140,000\n- Signing bonus: $15,000 (paid in your first payroll)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n\nWhy this works: We\u2019re saying yes to the August start and the full Blair rotation because we agree it\u2019s a high-value way to accelerate your impact. In return, we need your leadership anchored in New Haven after the rotation \u2014 that\u2019s where the most urgent marketing build-out is, where you\u2019ll get the fastest wins, and where executive partners are co-located for cross-functional velocity. The comp structure balances steady base with a strong transition bonus, and we\u2019ll support you with relocation to New Haven and temporary housing during the DC rotation. We\u2019ll also set a regular travel cadence to Philadelphia for key stakeholders, and we can revisit long-term location needs after your first year once the team is fully humming.\n\nIf we can align on this package \u2014 August start + Blair rotation + New Haven home base with 0 remote and 2 weeks\u2019 vacation, at $140k base and a $15k signing bonus \u2014 are you ready to move forward? If Philadelphia as a home base is a must-have, tell me specifically what change on compensation would bridge it; if we need to move dollars, I\u2019d rather do it through a one-time bonus than locking it into base.""]",,

How much room do you have above $165k?\n- You mentioned a $40k bonus max\u2014can we lock in the full $40k today, or are there approvals needed?\n- Any strong staffing needs by location (Philly vs New Haven vs Seoul) I should know about?\n\nIf we can secure the Blair rotation, an Aug 1+ start, and an in-office setup, I can be flexible on location (e.g., Philly vs Seoul) and, if necessary, consider moving vacation from 4.0 to 3.5 weeks\u2014provided the overall comp holds strong.

I'd also like to address many of the other issues before we talk about. First, I would prefer a start date that is in July as we need to align with key internal timelines. Does July 5th or July 15th work for you? To your location point, we more so have a need in Seoul and New Haven. Which one is better for you and why is that? Ideally, we were thinking for your salary to start off in the $110,000 range. Is there a way we can meet somewhere closer to that value?

I hear you on Aug 1 and a meaningful sign-on, with Blair exposure close behind. On our side, the two must-haves are: anchoring the role in New Haven and keeping vacation at 2 weeks in year one.

That said, a few points where I need to be firm:\n\n1. Base salary\n$135k is meaningfully below market for a Director-level online marketing role. The true comp range for is $145k\u2013$155k, and competitive hires are typically above that band, not below. Given the scope and expectations you\u2019ve outlined, $165k is reasonable and appropriate. A sign-on doesn\u2019t fully substitute for ongoing comp at this level.\n\n2. Vacation\nI\u2019m surprised we\u2019re renegotiating annual leave at this level. 4 weeks is the norm for senior leaders, and it materially affects sustainability and performance. Two weeks is not workable for me.\n\n3. Start date\nI need to be clear that August 1 is non-negotiable. I have a prior tournament commitment in July that I must honor. I\u2019m fully ready to hit the ground running starting Aug 1.\n\n4. Blair rotation\nFor clarity: the 3-month rotation with Blair is a yes/no item. Targeted exposure, touchpoints, or visits don\u2019t substitute for that experience and wouldn\u2019t change my decision calculus.\n\nSo, to be transparent, the package that works for me looks like this:\n\nStart date: August 1\nWork location: New Haven, CT\nBase salary: $165,000\nRemote work: 0 days/week\nSigning bonus: $40,000\nVacation: 4 weeks\nBlair rotation: 3-month DC rotation with Blair\n\nI\u2019m excited about the role and the impact we can make together, and I\u2019m already giving ground on location and on-site expectations to meet your needs.

That's why we have enhanced in-office perks available, such as extended cafeteria hours, laundry service, and wellness health coaching. \n- The Blair rotation is not standard and would require internal counsel to draft a revised contract. \n\nI'm going to be completely honest, your current package request would bring me to negative value right now and it wouldn't make sense to hire you if we are losing value to hire you. \nI'm willing to make concessions, of course, because I really value your talent and want you to work in the company. \n\nSo I can start by offering two concessions: 1. A later start date of August 12th as you requested, and 2. the Blair Rotation, I understand you are very interested in it and we are willing to take the hit in terms of value if it increases your utility curve. \n\nWhat do you think about the rest of the points?

If we can align on a few key terms, I\u2019m ready to move quickly.\n\nHere\u2019s a package that would let me say yes today:\n- Work location: Philadelphia as my home office\n- Blair rotation: 3-month rotation in DC under Blair, then transition to the main office\n- Start date: August 19 (open to any date on or after August 1)\n- Base salary: $185,000\n- Remote work: 0 days per week (in-person)\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n\nWhy this works: Starting August or later paired with a focused 3-month DC rotation under Blair sets me up to ramp fast, build critical internal relationships, and bring immediate leverage back to the main office. I\u2019m most effective in-person with a high-energy team, which is why I\u2019m asking for an onsite setup. And given the scope and impact expected for this seat, the base and bonus reflect the value I\u2019m confident I can deliver.\n\nA few quick checks so we can finalize:\n- Can you confirm $40k is within your signing bonus authority for this role?\n- What\u2019s the approved base range for Director-level hires?\n- Any constraints on an August 1 or later start paired with a 3-month DC rotation?\n- Are there location needs that make Philadelphia more or less preferred right now?\n- What\u2019s standard vacation at this level, and is 4 weeks feasible?\n- How strictly is onsite enforced at the Philly office?\n\nI\u2019m aiming to make this easy. If we need to adjust a lever (for example, location or a single WFH day), I\u2019m open to discussing that in the context of the overall package. The two pieces I\u2019d like to keep intact are the August-or-later start and the Blair rotation, as they directly impact my ability to hit the ground running. How does this land on your side?"", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: Hi, we're quite satisfied with your qualifications! However, there are some details regarding your onboarding that we need to coordinate. I've received your proposal and understand that you want to start as soon as possible.  Therefore, after discussing with the team, we've made some adjustments to our original plan based on your expectations. However, there are also some points that we are quite firm on and need to discuss with you.\nWe hope the candidate can start in New Haven or Seoul. Considering you've been working in New York, I think New Haven would be a better option for you: it's still in the US and relatively close to your previous network (New York). If you were to start in Philadelphia, we would have some concerns about whether your previously accumulated marketing network would still be useful. I see that you don't have any specific commitments in July, is that correct? Also, because this position has project requirements starting in July, although I don't require you to start before July, I hope you can start on July 5th. This was also the reason why we wanted you to start as soon as possible when we recruited you. As for the Blair rotation, I think there's no need to rush it at this time. You can start first, get familiar with the team, and then do the Blair rotation later. Moreover, the Blair rotation requires a relatively complex internal process, and I need to coordinate with Blair's team regarding their schedule. I'm worried that if we delay things, there might be many more complications.\nRegarding your base salary, I want you to understand that the current industry range for this salary is between $120,000 and $135,000. Considering your previous work in New York, we can appropriately increase it for you, for example, to $125,000. After all, we haven't worked with you before, so the initial base salary is a bit lower, but I think you are a very diligent and enthusiastic person, and I believe you have a friendly personality and will integrate well with the team. Therefore, I have applied to the company to increase your signing bonus from the original $20,000 to $25,000.\nOur company culture highly values \u200b\u200bwork-life balance, so there is rarely any overtime. However, since you're just starting, long holidays might affect project progress, especially in the coming years. The standard annual leave for this level is also 2 weeks, so I'm still giving you 2 weeks of annual leave. Once you've integrated better with the team and the quality of your work during remote work is guaranteed, you can apply for longer annual leave later."", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Appreciate the clarity\u2014that helps. I hear you on July project needs, location fit, and deferring the Blair rotation until we\u2019re settled.\n\nGiven that, here\u2019s a package I can accept and sign this week that aligns to your priorities while setting me up to deliver:\n\nOption A (preferred, aligns with your in-person and location needs)\n- Work location: Seoul (onsite)\n- Start date: August 12 (any date on/after Aug 1 works)\n- Base salary: $178,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (Blair mentioned this is the ceiling)\n- Remote work: 0 days/week (fully onsite)\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n- Blair rotation: Not at start; revisit post-onboarding with your coordination\n\nWhy this works for you: You get me fully onsite (0 WFH) and in a location you flagged as viable. Starting in August gives me enough time to wrap prior commitments and, if Seoul is the home base, plan the relocation properly so I hit the ground running. I\u2019m happy to keep July light-touch\u2014available for a few setup calls so July projects don\u2019t lose momentum.\n\nIf July is truly immovable, here\u2019s a path that makes that feasible for me:\n\nOption B (only if you must have July)\n- Work location: Seoul (onsite)\n- Start date: July 15\n- Base salary: $185,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n- Blair rotation: Not at start; revisit later\n\nOn your earlier points:\n- Philadelphia: I hear the concern. Moving to Seoul addresses your location preference and maximizes in-person impact.\n- Blair rotation: Understood that starting with it now isn\u2019t workable. I\u2019m fine punting it and revisiting once I\u2019m established.\n- Vacation: I do want 4 weeks. It\u2019s important for sustainability at this scope, and it won\u2019t get in the way of delivery\u2014especially with me onsite full-time.\n- Base range: I know you cited $120\u2013135k bands. At Director level, given my NYC track record and the scope here, the base above reflects market for impact roles plus the relocation/on-site commitment.\n\nCan you confirm:\n- Which option (A: Aug 12 at $178k / B: July 15 at $185k) you can approve?\n- That $40k bonus is within your authority for this role?\n- That 4 weeks of vacation can be approved with either option?\n\nIf you can greenlight Option A or B as written, I\u2019m ready to accept immediately."", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: I insist that you work in New Haven. If you insist on working in Seoul and need time to coordinate, I can coordinate with the team to allow you to start after August. However, I must reiterate that the current industry salary range for this position is $120,000 to $135,000. I can offer you $130,000. If you accept this salary range, I can apply to the team for a $30,000 signing bonus for you. Regarding annual leave, based on your statement that you need extended annual leave because you feel it's important for maintaining the sustainability of your work performance, you will be working full-time on-site. However, our team is very concerned about long annual leave, so I can offer you one day of remote work per week to allow you more flexibility in managing your work time and work status. However, annual leave can only be two weeks.\nTherefore, I can offer you this option:\n- Work location: Seoul (on-site)\n- Start date: August 16th\n- Base salary: $130,000\n- Signing bonus: $30,000\n- Remote work: 1 day/week\n- Annual leave: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: Not arranged initially; to be discussed later\n\nI think our main disagreement currently lies in the significant difference in base salary. If you can work in New Haven, where we are most in need of your type of marketing talent, I can offer you a higher salary which is the top range of industry salary. Therefore, I can offer this option:\n- Work location: New Haven (on-site)\n- Start date: August 16th\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Signing bonus: $30,000\n- Remote work: 1 day/week\n- Annual leave: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: Not arranged initially; to be discussed later\n\nYou can choose either option, and we can sign the contract now."", ""Round 3.1 - The Candidate: Appreciate the clarity and the movement\u2014feels like we\u2019re close. I can commit today if we lock one of the following packages that align to your priorities and let me hit the ground running:\n\nOption 1 (New Haven \u2013 meets your top location and base constraints)\n- Work location: New Haven, CT (onsite, 0 days WFH)\n- Start date: August 19 (flexible to August 16)\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 3 weeks\n- Blair rotation: 3\u2011month rotation in DC under Blair, guaranteed within my first 9 months, then back to main office\n\nOption 2 (Seoul \u2013 if you prefer Seoul)\n- Work location: Seoul, Korea (onsite, 0 days WFH)\n- Start date: August 19 (flexible to August 16)\n- Base salary: $130,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n- Blair rotation: 3\u2011month rotation in DC under Blair, guaranteed within my first 9 months, then back to main office\n\nIn both options I\u2019ll be fully onsite (0 WFH), and I\u2019m available in July for light-touch calls to support your project kickoff. I\u2019m meeting you at your base cap and location needs; in return, I need the signing bonus at the role\u2019s ceiling and the Blair rotation written into the offer. If you can greenlight Option 1 or 2 as written, I\u2019ll sign today.\n\nWho can approve the $40k bonus and the written Blair rotation so we can finalize now?"", ""Round 3.2 - The Recruiter: Thank you for your reply. I can see that you are very excited about joining the team!\nI can agree to your request for the Blair rotation, but at the same time, I cannot agree to 3 weeks of annual leave. The team's schedule is already very tight, and agreeing to your rotation essentially gives you another 3 months of absence. If you also take 3 weeks of annual leave, the team's project schedule will be extremely strained. Therefore, I can offer you a signing bonus of $40,000. If you agree, I can offer you the following arrangement:\n- Work location: New Haven (on-site)\n- Start date: August 16th\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Remote work: 1 day/week\n- Annual leave: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: A 3-month rotation in Washington D.C. under Blair's leadership, guaranteed to be completed within the first 9 months of employment, after which you will return to the main office."", ""Round 4.1 - The Candidate: Thanks for moving on the $40k bonus and confirming the Blair rotation\u2014those are the big pieces for me.

You pick which is easiest to approve\u2014everything else stays exactly as you just proposed (Aug 16 start, $135,000 base, $40,000 bonus, 1 day/week remote, Blair rotation in writing within 9 months):\n\n- Option A: New Haven with 2.5 weeks of vacation (instead of 2 weeks).\nOR\n- Option B: Seoul as the work location at a $135,000 base (vacation remains 2 weeks).\n\nIf neither A nor B is possible, I can still sign today if we simply note the role as fully onsite (0 WFH) instead of 1 day/week\u2014no other changes.

However, we will of course still try our best to offer an attractive package. May we ask in advance if you have other offers and what the general package is? Although we would love to have you join we can't discourage from joining a different firm if the total package is more attractive - we encourage you to choose the firm with the best package and hence would like to understand what other offer you may have.\n\nNow to better understand your preferences we would like to ask which options you prefer for each pair of choices (either A or B, pls consider each pair seperately):\n\nPair 1: Base wage vs Bonus\nA: $120k Wage + $40k Bonus\nOR\nB: $128k Wage + $0k Bonus\n\nPair 2: Base wage vs Location\nA: $110k Wage + Philadelphia\nOR\nB: $130k Wage + New Haven\n\nPair 3: Location vs Vacation\nA:  Philadelphia + 4 weeks\nOR\nB: New Haven + 2 weeks\n\nPair 4: Vacation vs Remote days\nA:  2 weeks + 2 remote days\nOR\nB: 2.5 weeks + 0 remote days\n\nPair 5: Start date vs Bonus\nA:  Aug 1 + $0 bonus\nOR\nB: July 15th + $10k bonus\n\nPair 6: Blair rotation vs base salary\nA:  Yes to rotation + $120k base\nOR\nB: No rotation + $120500 base\n\nTell me for each pair which one option you prefer and please also why, and please tell me at the end a ranking of the 7 item, according to each items importance to you plus explanation if possible.\n\nAfterwards I will propose a package that is doable for us and hopefully attractive to you."", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Option A: Continue Negotiation\n\nThanks for laying that out transparently\u2014I appreciate it. I\u2019m excited about C&C and I\u2019m confident we can find a package that works for both sides.\n\nOn other offers: I\u2019m in late-stage conversations at two firms. Out of respect for confidentiality I won\u2019t share their specifics, but if we can align around the structure I\u2019ve proposed below, C&C would be my clear first choice.\n\nYour A/B pairs and my preferences (with brief rationale):\n\n- Pair 1 (Base vs Bonus): A \u2014 $120k base + $40k bonus\n  Rationale: I\u2019m flexible on distribution given budget constraints, and a strong signing bonus helps with immediate transition costs. I still want the base calibrated to the role\u2019s scope.\n\n- Pair 2 (Base vs Location): B \u2014 $130k base + New Haven\n  Rationale: Philadelphia is my preference, but if there\u2019s a meaningful base premium tied to New Haven, I\u2019m open to it.\n\n- Pair 3 (Location vs Vacation): A \u2014 Philadelphia + 4 weeks\n  Rationale: Proximity to NYC supports faster ramp, and 4 weeks aligns with the culture you described and how I sustain high performance.\n\n- Pair 4 (Vacation vs Remote): B \u2014 2.5 weeks + 0 remote days\n  Rationale: I\u2019m most effective fully in-person. For clarity, my target is 0 remote days with 4 weeks vacation; this answer just reflects the forced A/B choice.\n\n- Pair 5 (Start vs Bonus): A \u2014 August 1 + $0 bonus\n  Rationale: A start of August 1 or later is essential to do the Blair rotation properly and onboard effectively. I\u2019m not trading start date for cash.\n\n- Pair 6 (Blair Rotation vs Base): A \u2014 Yes to rotation + $120k base\n  Rationale: The 3-month DC rotation with Blair is a unique accelerator for impact; a tiny base delta doesn\u2019t offset that value.\n\nMy ranked priorities (most to least important):\n1) Start date (August 1 or later) \u2014 must-have for a clean onboarding and to enable the Blair rotation.\n2) Blair rotation (3 months in DC, then main office) \u2014 must-have.\n3) Total compensation at signing (base + signing bonus) \u2014 I\u2019m looking for a strong, market-reflective base and the full bonus within your cap; I\u2019m flexible on mix, with a preference for higher base long term.\n4) Vacation \u2014 aiming for 4 weeks to match culture and performance sustainability.\n5) Remote work \u2014 0 days/week; I want to be fully in-person with the team and leaders.\n6) Location \u2014 Philadelphia preferred; open to New Haven only with a substantial salary premium.\n7) Everything else is secondary.\n\nEfficient path to a deal:\n- If Philadelphia is feasible, I can accept today at:\n  \u2022 Philadelphia; Start Aug 15; Blair rotation 3 months in DC then to main office\n  \u2022 Base $185,000; Signing bonus $40,000\n  \u2022 Remote 0 days/week; Vacation 4 weeks\n\n- If the role must sit in New Haven for headcount reasons, I can consider:\n  \u2022 New Haven; Start Aug 15; Blair rotation 3 months in DC then to main office\n  \u2022 Base $205,000; Signing bonus $40,000\n  \u2022 Remote 0 days/week; Vacation 4 weeks\n\nKey confirmations I need to finalize:\n- Your best total cash envelope (base + bonus) for Philadelphia vs New Haven with an Aug 1+ start and the 3-month Blair rotation.\n- Whether 4 weeks vacation is within policy at the director level (if there\u2019s a formal cap, what is it?).\n- No required remote minimums (I prefer 0 days/week), and confirmation Blair is available for the 3-month DC rotation starting after August 1.\n\nIf you can align closely with the Philadelphia package above, I\u2019m ready to sign. If not, please share your strongest counter in both locations under the Aug 1+ start and Blair rotation so we can close this quickly."", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: We really appreciate your transparency on sharing your preferences, yet your first and second proposal are far out of our budget, especially the base pay. It is near impossible for us to pay you more than 120k base given budget constraints.\n\nHowever given we really like you, we are willing to make an exception and pay your the max bonus of 40k. \n\nIn exchange for the lower base, we are happy allow you to start in August and complete the Blair rotation. \n\nFor vacation we can give you 2 weeks as it is important to us that you quickly get used to the job and integrate into the team. \n\nNew Haven is actually closer to NY than Phildephia! We would love to see you grow in your role there as there is more demand in that office and you will also have more responsibility there. \n\nHappy that we're aligned on the idea of no romote - we would love that as well. \n\nDeal? Can't wait for you to join our ranks."", ""Round 3.1 - The Candidate: Option A: Continue Negotiation\n\nI appreciate you putting real flexibility on the table with the August start, the Blair rotation, 0 remote, and the full $40k signing bonus. Those pieces work for me.\n\nWhere we\u2019re stuck is base and vacation. A $120k base and 2 weeks\u2019 vacation won\u2019t set me up for success in a Director role. I want to make this work here, so let me give you two concrete packages I can accept today if you can get an exception approved on base. I\u2019ve framed one around your New Haven preference:\n\nPath 1 \u2014 Philadelphia (my preference)\n- Location: Philadelphia (after the Blair rotation)\n- Start: August 15\n- Blair rotation: Yes (3 months in DC, then main office)\n- Base: $150,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n\nPath 2 \u2014 New Haven (reflecting your stated premium there)\n- Location: New Haven\n- Start: August 15\n- Blair rotation: Yes (3 months in DC, then main office)\n- Base: $160,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 3.5 weeks\n  - If needed to finalize today, I can flex this to 3 weeks.\n\nI\u2019m not trading start date or the Blair rotation for cash; those are core to onboarding and impact. If base truly cannot rise above $120k, we likely won\u2019t be able to bridge this. If you can escalate for an exception, I\u2019m ready to sign on one of the two packages above today. What can you get approved right now?"", ""Round 3.2 - The Recruiter: The base is still way too high, sorry to break it to you. We can offer you the previous package as a PACKAGE but you cannot simply cherry pick what you like and improve the other items without other concessions.\n\nGiven you are willing to work in New Haven, we can increase the wage to 125k, but first-year base wag is really extremely difficult for us to raise and risks jeopardizing the deal. We cannot raise the wage higher than this without other concession on your part.\n\nIf we can agree on 2.5 weeks of vacation, we can increase the wage to 127.5k."", ""Round 4.1 - The Candidate: Option A: Continue Negotiation\n\nI appreciate that we\u2019re fully aligned on the August start, the 3\u2011month Blair DC rotation, 0 remote, and the $40k signing bonus. I can also align with your headcount preference and commit to New Haven as my home office after the rotation.\n\nIf you can approve the following as a single package, I will sign today:\n\n- Location: New Haven (after the Blair rotation)\n- Start Date: August 15 (meets your August 1+ window)\n- Blair Rotation: Yes \u2014 3 months in DC under Blair, then move to the main office\n- Base Salary: $160,000\n- Signing Bonus: $40,000\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 3 weeks\n\nThis keeps your package structure intact and gives you everything you\u2019ve prioritized (New Haven, in-person, August start, Blair rotation, no cherry\u2011picking) while setting the role up for long\u2011term success.\n\nDo you have authority to approve $160k base for this package now? If not, what concrete escalation path can we use to get this approved today?

Who needs to sign off and what\u2019s the timeline?\n- Is an August 19 start workable? If not, what\u2019s the earliest the team truly needs and why?\n- What salary band do you have for this role, and who approves at the $185k level?\n- Can you confirm the signing bonus ceiling at $40k, payout timing (first paycheck vs. split), and any clawback terms?\n- Is 0 WFH days consistent with the current onsite policy for the Philly office?\n- Are 4 weeks of vacation standard or approvable at this level?\n\nIf we need to move a lever, my top priorities are: August-or-later start and the Blair rotation, then being onsite in Philadelphia.

Based on where I can deliver outsized impact fastest, here\u2019s a package that would set me up to ramp quickly and drive results:\n\n- Location: Philadelphia, PA (home office)\n- Blair rotation: 3-month rotation in Washington, DC under Blair, then transition to the main office\n- Start date: August 19 (any start on or after August 1 works)\n- Base salary: $185,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week (I prefer to be in-office with the team)\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (paid at start)\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n\nBriefly why this works: I do my best work embedded with cross-functional partners, and a full in-office cadence speeds execution and mentorship. The DC rotation under Blair would give me immediate traction with Government Affairs\u2014highly relevant to payer, regulatory, and partnership strategies that influence digital growth. An August start lets me hit day one fully recharged and ready for the DC rotation, so I can deliver early wins in Q4.\n\nA few quick questions to make sure we\u2019re aligned:\n- What\u2019s the approved salary band for this role, and who needs to sign off if we land at $185k?\n- Is a $40k sign-on within budget at this level, and how is it typically structured and timed?\n- Are there any policy constraints around 4 weeks of vacation for Directors?\n- From your side, any constraints on a three-month DC rotation under Blair beginning after Aug 1 and then Philadelphia as my ongoing home office?\n\nI\u2019m aiming to keep the August start and the Blair rotation intact, as those are key to ramp and impact. If it helps us get to yes, I can show some flexibility on one remote day per week or nudging vacation by a half-week. How does this package look on your end, and where do you see pushback or approvals we should tackle first?"", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: Hello, thank you so much for the information you provided. \nLet me tell you, the hiring team is eager for you to start. So let's tackle this points one by one, but first, let me tell you the ideal package for the company:\n\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Blair rotation: No\n- Start date: July 5th\n- Base Salary: $125,832\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $10,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n\n\nThis works for us because: \n- The New Haven office has the greatest need for marketing talent right now and this position was originally thought for that location.\n- Starting on July 5th will ensure you are aligned with key internal timelines and onboarding activities - making sure you hit the ground running and we can provide the best onboarding for you. \n- The base salary should be kept at a sustainable range, I'm providing you with an amount that the hiring team will approve of and is the typical salary for this position.\n- The company prefers to work in office all days of the week because mentorship is key for team development - it seems that we are aligned at this point\n- As per the signing bonus, we typically don't offer them, but I'm making an exception and providing $10,000\n- Since the company values work-life balance, 2 weeks of vacations per year is ideal, since extended vacations can disrupt project flow critical years ahead, optimizing work hours over headcount. That's why we have enhanced in-office perks available, such as extended cafeteria hours, laundry service, and wellness health coaching. \n- The Blair rotation is not standard and would require internal counsel to draft a revised contract. \n\nI'm going to be completely honest, your current package request would bring me to negative value right now and it wouldn't make sense to hire you if we are losing value to hire you. \nI'm willing to make concessions, of course, because I really value your talent and want you to work in the company. \n\nSo I can start by offering two concessions: 1. A later start date of August 19th as you requested, and 2. the Blair Rotation, I understand you are very interested in it and we are willing to take the hit in terms of value if it increases your utility curve. \n\nWhat do you think about the rest of the points? Are you willing to be flexible?"", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: I really appreciate you leaning in on the Blair rotation and the August 19 start\u2014that\u2019s exactly what I need to ramp fast and hit Q4 running.

Here are two ready-to-sign packages\u2014either works for me, depending on what\u2019s easier for you to approve:\n\nOption A (Philadelphia, preferred)\n- Location: Philadelphia, PA\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC under Blair, then main office\n- Start date: August 19 (\u2265 Aug 1)\n- Base salary: $180,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n\nOption B (If New Haven is required)\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC under Blair, then main office\n- Start date: August 19 (\u2265 Aug 1)\n- Base salary: $185,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n\nNotes and flexibility:\n- If bonus budget truly caps below $40k, we can shift dollars into base to keep the package balanced. I\u2019m open to the right mix.\n- If vacation is the sticking point, I can consider 3.5 weeks to help you get approvals\u2014but I\u2019d like to keep the comp intact.\n- Blair mentioned $40k as a possible ceiling on the sign-on\u2014if that\u2019s approvable, great; if not, tell me the max you can get today.\n\nWhat\u2019s the approval path for the base and sign-on at these levels, and who needs to sign off on Philadelphia as the home office?

I\u2019m excited about the role and I think we\u2019re close, especially since we\u2019re aligned on the Blair rotation and being fully in-office.\n\nA few quick reactions and a constructive path forward:\n\n- Start date: July 5 won\u2019t work. For the Blair DC rotation to be effective and for me to transition cleanly, I need an August 1 or later start. August 12 is ideal on my side\u2014can we lock that?\n- Blair rotation: The 3-month DC rotation under Blair is a must-have for me and a big accelerator for the business. Let\u2019s confirm that in principle.\n- Location: I hear the pressure on New Haven. While Philly would be my first choice, I can move off of that to help you\u2014Seoul is a strong fit for me and still aligns with your preferences better than Philly. Let\u2019s set Seoul as the post-rotation location.\n- Remote: 0 days/week is perfect; fully aligned.\n\nHere\u2019s a package I can say yes to quickly if you can approve it:\n- Start date: August 12 (August 1 or later)\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC with Blair, then transition to main office\n- Location: Seoul\n- Base salary: $160,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n- Remote: 0 days/week (fully in-office)\n\nIf the $40k bonus needs to be partly rebalanced into base, I\u2019m open to that\u2014my preference is to keep base strong. For example, $165k base with a $35k bonus also works for me.\n\nOn vacation: I understand 2 weeks is standard. What\u2019s the maximum you can do at the Director level? If 4 weeks is a stretch, can we agree on 3.5 weeks?\n\nTo help us both move fast:\n- Can we agree today in principle on August 1+ start and the 3-month Blair rotation?\n- Is Seoul acceptable on your side as the post-rotation location?\n- With Seoul, what base range can you support alongside a $40k signing bonus (or the $165k base / $35k bonus mix)?\n- What\u2019s the ceiling on vacation if 4 weeks isn\u2019t standard? Would 3.5 weeks be approvable?\n\nIf Seoul is tough and New Haven becomes a must-have, I can consider it, but I\u2019d need a meaningfully stronger overall package to make that trade worthwhile."", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: Thanks for providing your priorities here.

I am so excited to be chatting with you today! I'm thrilled by the opportunity to work with you. I'm curious about which of the issues are most important to you. From my standpoint, I am most interested in an August 1st start date and a rotation with Blair and a large signing bonus that will allow me to get set up in a new city for the job. What about you?"", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: Fantastic to meet you, and we\u2019re excited about you joining as well. Let me be transparent about what matters most on our side so we can build a package that works for both of us.\n\nTop priorities for us:\n- Start date: July 5th is ideal (July 15th is workable). It lines up with a major Q3 launch and onboarding cohort.\n- Work location: New Haven, CT. That\u2019s where the core team and cross\u2011functional partners sit, and where we need leadership most.\n- In\u2011office presence: Directors here set the tone\u2014standard is 0 remote days/week for the ramp and team mentorship.\n- Vacation: 2 weeks in year one, plus company holidays. We rely on continuity with a lean org.\n\nOn Blair/DC: a 3\u2011month DC rotation this year won\u2019t work on our side. But I can commit to structured collaboration with Blair\u2014standing strategy sessions, priority project ownership with her team, and targeted DC visits (e.g., 2 days/month) so you get exposure without delaying the launch or your ramp.\n\nHere\u2019s a concrete package to get us started:\n- Start Date: July 5th\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $134,000\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s)/week\n- Signing Bonus: $0 (we can allocate funds here contingent on start/no\u2011rotation)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: No\n\nIf we align on July 5th and no 3\u2011month rotation, I can put meaningful dollars into a signing bonus to support your move\u2014up to $10k. If July 15th (still no rotation), I can stretch into the low\u2011 to mid\u2011teens, up to $15k.\n\nA few quick questions to calibrate:\n- When you say \u201clarge\u201d signing bonus, what exact number are you targeting?\n- What base salary are you aiming for?\n- Are you open to New Haven as your home base?\n- If we secure the Blair collaboration/short DC visits, can you commit to July 5th or July 15th?\n\nIf everything else lines up, we can revisit one remote day/week down the line, but our strong preference is to start fully on\u2011site to maximize your leadership impact."", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: I am open to a July 15th start date and 0 remote days. I am happy to concede on those points, which obviously matter to you. In terms of a signing bonus, I am thinking in the $30,000 to $40,000 range, especially if the expectation is that I move to New Haven which I have no interest in and would be quite the concession. Obviously, I want to work with you all and will do what I can to make this an incredible opportunity for both of us, but if a Blair rotation is off the table and I end up having to move to New Haven, I am going to expect a much larger salary, closer to $250,000, a large signing bonus, and more vacation time than 2 weeks."", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate you flexing to July 15 and 0 remote\u2014that aligns well with how we need this role to operate.\n\nOn comp: a $250k base and a $30k\u2013$40k sign-on aren\u2019t possible for this Director level.

Likewise, a 3\u2011month Blair/DC rotation this year won\u2019t work\u2014we need you embedded with the team for the Q3 launch and ramp.\n\nHere\u2019s a package I can get approved now:\n- Start Date: July 15\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $136,000\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s)/week\n- Signing Bonus: $15,000 (to support your move)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks (company holidays in addition)\n- Blair Rotation: No (we\u2019ll set up structured collaboration with Blair and targeted DC travel, e.g., ~2 days/month in Q3\u2013Q4)\n\nIf New Haven is truly a non-starter after this, the only alternative location I can explore is Seoul (same terms); Philadelphia isn\u2019t an option for this role.\n\nIf you can confirm New Haven as your home base and no Blair rotation, I\u2019ll lock this in today.

However, start after August 1st allows for a rotation with Blair. \n\nFor salary, I aim for $165000 at least, or you have to give $40000 signing bonus which can beneficial as it's a one time payment instead of salary which is paid monthly.

Signing bonus is important for me because I need extra cash for loans and new apartment, and Blair, my interviewer, mentioned a $40,000 maximum, so It makes sense to request at least half of it, which is $20000.

Based on what I\u2019ve learned so far, here\u2019s a package that sets me up to deliver quickly and at a high level:\n\n- Work Location: Philadelphia, PA\n- Blair Rotation: Yes \u2014 3-month DC rotation with Blair to start, then transition to the main office\n- Start Date: August 15 (or later)\n- Base Salary: $185,000\n- Remote Work Policy: In-office, 0 days/week remote\n- Signing Bonus: $40,000\n- Vacation Time: 4 weeks\n\nA few reasons behind this bundle:\n- The Blair rotation, coupled with an August start, would accelerate my ramp and relationships across Government Affairs and Marketing.\n- Being in-office full-time is important to me for pace, collaboration, and mentorship.\n- Philly lets me hit the ground running with proximity to my network and to NYC.\n\nCould you help me understand a few things so we can move quickly?\n1) Salary: What\u2019s the approved band for this role, and at what level do additional approvals kick in? What data would you need to support $185K?\n2) Signing bonus: How firm is the $40K cap, and how is it typically structured (payment timing, clawback terms)?\n3) Constraints: Any limitations on an August 15+ start, the Blair DC rotation, or seat availability in Philly?\n\nAmong these elements, which are easiest versus hardest for you to get approved? If we align on the structure, I\u2019m ready to move fast."", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: Thanks for the thoughtful bundle and for making it clear you want to move fast. I do too, so I\u2019m going to answer your questions directly and then put forward a few MESOs so we\u2019re not negotiating line by line.\n\nOn salary and approvals\nFor Director of Online Marketing, the approved base salary band is 135,000 to 145,000. Once we go above 145,000 it effectively becomes a different leveling conversation and triggers additional executive approvals that we are not set up to pursue for this role. In plain terms, 185,000 is not supportable for this position, even with data, because it would break internal equity.\n\nOn the signing bonus cap and structure\n40,000 is the firm cap. Typical structure is paid shortly after start, with standard clawback language if someone leaves within an agreed period. We can walk through the exact timing and repayment terms, but the ceiling itself is real.\n\nOn constraints\nWork location: the business need is New Haven as the home base. Philadelphia is well covered, and putting the role there would create the exact leadership gap we are hiring to solve. The upside for you is that New Haven is where the cross functional leadership sits, which is the fastest path to the exposure and scope you\u2019re looking for.\nBlair rotation: we cannot put a formal three month DC rotation into the contract. It creates onboarding and reporting line complexity and requires non standard legal work. What we can do is design a structured Blair partnership that gets you the outcome without the contractual rotation.\nStart date: August 15 is doable, but earlier starts are meaningfully easier for the business.\n\nRather than split the pie immediately, I want to maximize the pie first by giving you real Blair access and a clear ramp plan, then use a clean package to finalize. Here are three MESOs I can support today, all fully in office, all New Haven as home base, all with a structured Blair plan:\n\nTo keep this efficient, here are three sign-today packages (MESOs). Same across all: New Haven home base, fully in-office, and a structured Blair plan (weekly 1:1 plus DC on-sites in first 90 days), no formal rotation.\n\nOption 1 (best overall value, fastest ramp)\nStart July 15\nBase $125,000\nSigning bonus $40,000\nVacation 3 weeks\n\nOption 2 (more comp)\nStart August 1\nBase $130,000\nSigning bonus $40,000\nVacation 3 weeks\n\nOption 3 (more time)\nStart August 15\nBase $128,000\nSigning bonus $40,000\nVacation 3.5 weeks\n\nWhich option is closest to what you need to sign?"", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Appreciate the clarity and the MESOs. I can flex to your business needs on two big points so we can unlock the rest:\n\n- Home base: New Haven works.\n- Blair: no formal 3\u2011month DC rotation in the contract; I\u2019m good with a structured partnership (weekly 1:1s and DC on-sites in the first 90 days).\n\nWith those aligned, here\u2019s a clean, signable package that lets me hit the ground running and matches Director-level scope:\n\n- Start date: August 15\n- Base salary: $150,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (standard timing/clawback is fine)\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n- Remote: 0 days/week, fully in-office New Haven\n- Blair: structured access as you outlined (no formal rotation)\n\nIf $150,000 requires approvals you\u2019re not set up to run, I can sign today at $145,000 base with the same terms above (Aug 15 start, $40k bonus, 4 weeks vacation, fully in-office New Haven, structured Blair plan).\n\nGiven I\u2019m moving to New Haven and removing the contractual rotation, landing at $150k (or $145k if that\u2019s your immediate authority) with 4 weeks PTO makes this a yes for me today. How would you like to proceed?"", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: Appreciate this, and I want to keep the momentum. We\u2019re fully aligned on the big structural pieces: New Haven as home base, fully in-office, and the structured Blair partnership with weekly 1:1s plus DC on-sites in the first 90 days. The signing bonus at 40,000 is also fine with standard timing and clawback.\n\nWhere we can\u2019t get to yes is combining top of band base with 4 weeks PTO at hire. That combination will not clear internal equity review for a Director entry package.\n\nSo instead of haggling line by line, here are two clean, sign-today packages (MESOs). Everything is the same except base and PTO.\n\nOption 1, best compensation within constraints\nStart date August 15\nBase salary 1350,000\nSigning bonus 40,000\nVacation 3 weeks\nRemote 0 days per week\nNew Haven, fully in-office\nBlair structured partnership as discussed\n\nOption 2, more time off\nStart date August 15\nBase salary 130,000\nSigning bonus 40,000\nVacation 3.5 weeks\nRemote 0 days per week\nNew Haven, fully in-office\nBlair structured partnership as discussed\n\nIf it helps bridge the gap, I\u2019m also happy to put in writing a formal compensation review at the 6 month mark tied to clearly defined outcomes, so we can revisit base based on delivered impact rather than debate predictions today. That\u2019s the cleanest contingent contract approach that protects internal equity while rewarding performance.\n\nTell me which option you want to sign, and I\u2019ll move it to final paperwork today."", ""Round 3.1 - The Candidate: Appreciate the clarity and where we\u2019re already aligned: New Haven home base, fully in-office (0 remote), structured Blair partnership with weekly 1:1s and DC on-sites, August 15 start, and the $40,000 signing bonus with standard timing/clawback.\n\nTo close this today, I need to lock the base at $145,000. I can balance PTO between 3 and 3.5 weeks. Here are two signable packages\u2014both consistent with your constraints and internal equity, with a modest difference on PTO:\n\n- Option A (my preference):\n  \u2022 Start: August 15\n  \u2022 Base: $145,000\n  \u2022 Signing Bonus: $40,000\n  \u2022 Vacation: 3.5 weeks\n  \u2022 Remote: 0 days/week\n  \u2022 Location: New Haven, fully in-office\n  \u2022 Blair: structured partnership as discussed\n\n- Option B:\n  \u2022 Start: August 15\n  \u2022 Base: $145,000\n  \u2022 Signing Bonus: $40,000\n  \u2022 Vacation: 3 weeks\n  \u2022 Remote: 0 days/week\n  \u2022 Location: New Haven, fully in-office\n  \u2022 Blair: structured partnership as discussed\n\nI\u2019m also fine including the 6\u2011month compensation review in writing tied to clear outcomes if that helps you finalize. If you can greenlight Option A, I\u2019ll sign immediately; if not, I can sign Option B."", ""Round 3.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate this. We\u2019re completely aligned on the structure: New Haven home base, fully in-office, the structured Blair partnership, August 15, and the $40,000 signing bonus with standard timing and clawback.\n\nThat leaves just two levers: base and PTO. To keep internal equity clean and get this approved today, I can\u2019t pair top-of-band base with above-standard PTO at hire.\n\nSo here are two clean, sign-today packages. Everything else stays exactly as you outlined:\n\nOption 1\nStart August 15\nBase $145,000\nSigning bonus $40,000\nVacation 2.5 weeks\nRemote 0 days per week, fully in-office New Haven\nBlair structured partnership as discussed\n\nOption 2\nStart August 15\nBase $138,000\nSigning bonus $40,000\nVacation 3 weeks\nRemote 0 days per week, fully in-office New Haven\nBlair structured partnership as discussed\n\nIf you tell me which option you prefer, I\u2019ll get it finalized today.

I\u2019m especially excited about Blair\u2019s Government Affairs work; plugging into that for a focused sprint would supercharge my impact in the first 6\u201312 months.\n\nTo make this easy, here\u2019s a package I\u2019d be ready to sign today, built to set me up to deliver fast:\n\n- Location: Philadelphia as home base after the rotation\n- Blair Rotation: 3-month rotation in DC under Blair, then transition to the main office\n- Start Date: August 15\n- Base Salary: $190,000\n- Signing Bonus: $40,000\n- Remote Work: In-office (0 WFH days)\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n\nRationale in brief:\n- The DC rotation with Blair aligns my ramp with cross-functional priorities and accelerates external partnerships that feed online growth.\n- August start lines up cleanly with that rotation and lets me hit the ground running.\n- I prefer to be in-office with the team\u2014faster iteration, stronger mentorship, better lift in the first 90 days.\n- The comp reflects the scope and the value I expect to create out of the gate.\n\nA couple of quick checks so we can converge efficiently:\n- What\u2019s the top of the base salary band for this role, and how much flex is there for top candidates?\n- Can we confirm $40k is within the current signing bonus ceiling?\n- Which office most needs leadership coverage post-rotation\u2014is Philadelphia aligned with your resourcing priorities?\n- How firm is the hybrid policy for this level?\n- What\u2019s the standard vacation policy, and how often is 4 weeks approved at Director level?\n\nIf there are hard constraints on any one element, I\u2019m open to structured trades\u2014happy to move together if we can keep the overall package balanced and set up for impact. Where would you like to start?"", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: Hello!  thanks for putting together a clear package and the rationale. We\u2019re aligned on bringing you in; the question is how to structure it so you can have maximum impact fast.\n\nA few direct answers to your checks:\n\nBase salary: the band for this role is $135k\u2013$145k; $145k is the top end we can support. While this was not your goal, we can adjust on the signing bonus.\n\nSigning bonus: $40k is the hard ceiling.\n\nWhere leadership coverage is needed: the gap is in New Haven, not Philadelphia.\n\nIn-office expectation: at this level it\u2019s primarily in-person (0\u20131 day/week remote is the norm), so your preference for being in-office fits well.\n\nVacation: 3 weeks is the standard at Director entry; 4 weeks isn\u2019t something we typically approve on hire.\n\nOn Blair / DC: I like that you\u2019re thinking beyond pure performance marketing. What we can\u2019t easily do is a contractual 3-month rotation because it changes onboarding, reporting lines, and puts you away from the core growth team during the most important ramp window. What we can do is make Blair a meaningful part of your first 90 days with a structured plan (standing weekly time + planned DC on-sites), without turning it into a formal rotation.\n\nWith that context, here\u2019s the package I can stand behind:\n\nHome base: New Haven, CT\n\nStart date: July 15 (earlier gives you more runway to own the growth agenda)\n\nBase salary: $135,000\n\nSigning bonus: $35,000\n\nRemote: 0 days/week\n\nVacation: 3 weeks\n\nBlair: structured partnership + DC on-sites (not a formal 3-month rotation)\n\nThe reason I\u2019m firm on New Haven is simple: it\u2019s the best platform for your trajectory here. That\u2019s where the cross-functional leadership sits and where you\u2019ll get the highest visibility, the broadest scope, and the fastest path to enterprise-level responsibility.

I can move meaningfully to meet your constraints if we structure this as a single-package close.\n\nHere\u2019s a package I\u2019m ready to sign today:\n\n- Home base: New Haven, CT (I\u2019ll anchor the leadership gap there)\n- Blair: no formal 3-month rotation; instead, a structured plan (standing weekly 1:1s + planned DC on-sites in the first 90 days)\n- Start date: August 15\n- Base salary: $145,000 (top of band)\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (ceiling)\n- Remote: 0 days/week (fully in-office)\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n\nThat\u2019s real movement on my side\u2014dropping a formal Blair rotation and aligning to New Haven to give you coverage where you need it most. In exchange, locking Aug 15, $145k, the $40k bonus, and 4 weeks PTO sets me up to deliver sustainably at pace. I\u2019ll use July for pre-boarding and relationship-building so I hit the ground running on day one.\n\nIf 4 weeks truly can\u2019t be approved at hire even with the above trade-offs, tell me what you would need to see to unlock it; I\u2019m prioritizing long-term performance here.

Here\u2019s what I can sign off on today as a single package:\n\n- Home base: New Haven\n- Blair: no formal rotation, but the structured plan we discussed (weekly 1:1s + DC on-sites in the first 90 days)\n- Start date: August 15\n- Remote: fully in-office (0 days/week)\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (that\u2019s already our ceiling)\n- Base salary: $115,000\n\nI know that\u2019s a meaningful shift on base, but it\u2019s the clean way to fund the gap created by the later start while still giving you the time off you want and keeping the bonus at the maximum.

While we like you as a candidate, we will have to make a lot of adjustments to this offer to make this work. I would be super happy to welcome to the company but we are going to have to move a lot if you really want to come work for us, as your current proposal would be out of scope. \nLets look at it issue by issue and try to find a solution together that works for both of us:\n- Location: We are currently overstaffed in Philadelphia and do not need more people there, so this is not really an option. This would dramatically reduce your chance of progression in the company and therefore also impact your future packages and raises negatively. Can I give you a personal tip? If I were you I would start in New Haven. This is where we have seen people make the biggest progress and jumps within the company, the culture and people are way better, its a very close nit team and they have a lot of opportunities to grow (inlcuding the package we are negotiating). If I were you I would go to New Haven and then you can still make the jump to Philadelphia, but in a much better role! What do you think?\n- Blair Rotation: How important is the Blair rotation to you? Because we have a lot of interest in that rotation, so if I set this up, I will need to pull some other strings and have some other concession from your end on the location, remote work and vacation.\n- Start Date: We need you as soon as possible, because we want you aligned with key internal timelines and onboarding activities, which is in your full interest as we want you to be up to speed as soon as possible to get that steep learning curve that will hopefully also propell you to a bigger role in our firm. So we are looking at July 1st - would that work? That would be ideal to have you start building that network thoroughly before you get into the operational mix.\n- We are definetely going to have to move on the base salary. Our range is 100,000 - 110,000$, something we think is fair given the exposure you'll have to senior leadership, the chances of progression in this company, and the fact that you do not have an academic background in Marketing. \n- Remote Work: 0 days sounds good to us, we can ensure this if you like!\n- Signing Bonus: We usually do not pay signing bonuses. \n- Vacation: Here we need to move a lot. Given the great amount of responsibility you will be taking on and the great overall work-life balance we offer here, it is common practice for people to not have more than 1.5 weeks of vacation. Extended vacations can disrupt project flow, we have some Critical years ahead and enhanced in-office perks are available such as extended cafeteria hours, laundry service, and wellness health coaching. This means most of our employees actually take 1 week of vacation on average."", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Appreciate the candor\u2014and I\u2019m genuinely excited to make this work. I hear your constraints on Philly headcount, timelines, and budgets. Let me put a package on the table that directly meets your staffing needs while setting me up to ramp fast.\n\nHere\u2019s a package I can commit to if you can get approvals:\n- Location: Seoul, Korea (I\u2019m happy to go where the org needs me most; I\u2019ll relocate and be fully in-person)\n- Blair Rotation: 3-month rotation in DC under Blair starting in August, then move to my main office\n- Start Date: August 12 (any date on/after August 1 works)\n- Base Salary: $165,000\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week (fully in-office)\n- Signing Bonus: $40,000 (open to structure: 20k on start, 20k at 6 months; 12-month clawback if I leave)\n- Vacation: 4 weeks (pre-scheduled with blackout periods around launches; happy to lock dates upfront to avoid disruption)\n\nWhy this works for both sides:\n- You get me fully in-person, aligned to a location you\u2019re comfortable staffing (not Philly), and plugged into Blair\u2019s team for immediate cross-functional impact.\n- August 1+ enables the Blair rotation and gives me a clean, focused ramp. I\u2019m glad to help with pre-start onboarding touchpoints in July (meet key leaders, review plans) so I hit the ground running Day 1.\n- The base reflects Director scope and market. If there\u2019s a process for exceptions, I\u2019m asking you to run this package up the flagpole. The structured sign-on and vacation guardrails should help approvals.\n\nQuick confirmations to keep momentum:\n- Is Seoul a viable home office for this role?\n- Can you hold the August Blair rotation slot contingent on this package?\n- Who needs to sign off on base/sign-on/vacation, and what\u2019s the timeline? I\u2019m ready to sign as soon as we have those approvals."", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: Thank you for clarifying here, but we are still going to have to move a lot to make this work. \n- Location: to reiterate, your best shot for yourself is actually New Haven, not Seoul. Its way to far from our HQ. I would recommend New Haven - can I pen you in for that? Its the smartest choice.\n- Blair Rotation: As I said, the Blair rotation works, but only if you move for me on Base Salary and vacation. I need those numbers to come down to make this work. \n- Start Date: For the date it is not about check-ins but really about getting you set up, in front of senior leadership, clients and to understand the whole team before you get truly into the weeds in August already. How much is a lter start worth to you? What we could do is July 5th to give you those extra days in July to get settled. But we would need to move on vacation days then.\n- Base Salary: I can stretch to 118,000 for you, but just because it is you! You would be our highest paid director. \n- Remote Work: We can agree on 0 days - that works for us.\n- Signing Bonus: As I said we typically do not pay a signing bonus. If you are willing to move on base salary and vacation though, I can see if we can do 10,000.\n- Vacation: Here, the hard number counts for me. I am happy to do no lock in dates upfront because I know that can be stressful to plan and have not flexibility, but we need the overall number at 2 weeks max.\n\nDo we have a deal?"", ""Round 3.1 - The Candidate: I\u2019m glad we\u2019re aligned on in-person and I appreciate the transparency.

This is required to make the Blair rotation viable and to honor existing commitments. I\u2019m happy to do pre-start onboarding touchpoints in July so I hit the ground running Day 1.\n- Blair Rotation: 3-month DC rotation with Blair, then move to New Haven as my home office.\n\nGiven those, here are three packages you can choose from\u2014any one works for me. I\u2019m ready to sign immediately if you can approve one:\n\nOption 1 (market-aligned):\n- Base: $165,000\n- Signing Bonus: $40,000 (can split 20k at start / 20k at 6 months; 12-month clawback)\n- Vacation: 3.5 weeks\n\nOption 2 (balanced):\n- Base: $155,000\n- Signing Bonus: $40,000 (same structure/clawback ok)\n- Vacation: 3 weeks\n\nOption 3 (your lowest-vacation preference):\n- Base: $150,000\n- Signing Bonus: $40,000 (same structure/clawback ok)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n\nNotes:\n- Blair mentioned a $40k maximum signing bonus is possible; I\u2019m structuring it with a clawback and staggered payout to make approvals easier.\n- If base salary flexibility is truly limited, Option 3 gives you the leanest vacation while keeping the start date and rotation you need for impact. With New Haven and 0-remote already locked, this should be the cleanest approval path.\n\nCan you confirm:\n- August 1 (or later) start and the Blair rotation slot are green-lightable with New Haven and 0-remote?\n- Which of the three comp options you can approve today, or who we should pull in to finalize the comp/sign-on exception?

Given your flexibility on location and vacation, I think there\u2019s a clear path to a strong agreement if we focus on a structure that works cleanly on our side and sets you up for impact.\n\nWe can support a 3-month rotation with Blair, scheduled for Q4, as you suggested. That exposure is a meaningful exception on our side, and we want to make sure the rest of the package reflects the additional complexity it introduces but also the type of concessions we are ready to make to make you feel valuable to our team.\n\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s how we would structure an offer that balances Blair exposure with our internal constraints and sets you up for impact:\n\nAugust 12 works well as a start date and gives you a smooth transition into the role before the rotation begins. For the primary office, we\u2019d anchor the role in New Haven, where we have the greatest need for senior marketing leadership and where this position can have the most immediate visibility and impact once you return from DC.\n\nFrom a compensation standpoint, because we\u2019re supporting the Blair rotation, we need to be disciplined on costs. A base salary of $130,000 is aligned with our Director-level ranges and reflects the scope of the role at entry, while still positioning you for meaningful growth as impact is demonstrated. Where we can remain flexible is on upfront recognition, which is why we\u2019d include a $30,000 signing bonus, bringing strong total first-year compensation to $160,000 and acknowledging the value you bring.\n\nThe role would be office-first, which aligns well with your stated preference for an in-person, high-energy environment. On vacation, 2 weeks strikes the right balance given the critical first year and the additional time involved in the DC rotation.\n\nPutting it all together, here\u2019s the full package:\n\nStart date: August 12\nPrimary office (post-rotation): New Haven, CT\nBlair rotation: 3 months in DC in Q4, then return to New Haven\nBase salary: $130,000\nSigning bonus: $30,000\nRemote work: 0 days per week (office-first) as you perefered\nVacation: 2 weeks\n\nThis structure preserves the Blair exposure that\u2019s important to you while keeping the role sustainable and aligned on our side. If this direction works, I\u2019m confident we can finalize quickly."", ""Round 3.2 - The Candidate: Option A: Continue Negotiation\n\nI really appreciate you green\u2011lighting the Q4, 3\u2011month DC rotation and confirming August 12 and an office\u2011first setup. That nails the environment I\u2019m looking for. I can also commit to New Haven as my primary office after the rotation.\n\nWhere we\u2019re not aligned yet is base and time off. A $130k base and 2 weeks\u2019 vacation won\u2019t work for me.\n\nHere are two clean packages that would let me sign quickly while keeping the agreed structure intact:\n\nOption A (preferred)\n- Start: August 12 (August 1+)\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC in Q4, then return to New Haven\n- Primary office: New Haven\n- Base salary: $180,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 4 weeks\n\nOption B\n- Start: August 12\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC in Q4, then return to New Haven\n- Primary office: New Haven\n- Base salary: $175,000\n- Signing bonus: $40,000\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 3 weeks\n\nIf vacation needs to stay at 2 weeks in year one, I\u2019d need to see at least $185,000 on base to keep the economics whole. And just to keep us efficient: my floor to move forward is a $165,000 base, with the signing bonus set at $40,000.\n\nCan you confirm you can approve the $40k signing bonus and let me know which of the two options above you can get closest to on base and vacation? If we can align there, I\u2019m ready to finalize."", ""Round 4.1 - The Recruiter: I want to pause for a moment and reset the conversation so we\u2019re aligned on both substance and approach.\n\nWe\u2019ve made several significant commitments already, including an August 12 start, an office-first setup, New Haven as the primary office, and approving a Q4, three-month rotation with Blair. Those are real exceptions on our side and reflect the value we see in you.\n\nAt the same time, I need to be clear that the compensation levels you\u2019re proposing are well above what we consider appropriate for this role, particularly given the structure we\u2019ve already agreed to. Bases in the high-170s to 180s, combined with extended vacation, would place this position far outside our internal benchmarks and equity standards, and that\u2019s not something I\u2019m able to support.\n\nI also want to be transparent that the framing of your last message, especially positioning ultimatums around salary \u201cfloors,\u201d isn\u2019t a productive way for us to close. I\u2019m committed to a respectful, collaborative process, but we do need to operate within realistic boundaries on both sides.\n\nWith that said, here is a strong package I can approve that preserves the agreed structure and reflects our flexibility where it\u2019s possible:\n\nStart date: August 12\n\nPrimary office (post-rotation): New Haven, CT\n\nBlair rotation: 3 months in DC in Q4, then return to New Haven\n\nBase salary: $150,000\n\nSigning bonus: $35,000\n\nRemote work: 0 days/week (office-first)\n\nVacation: 2 weeks\n\nThis keeps total first-year compensation highly competitive while remaining aligned with our internal constraints and long-term sustainability.\n\nIf this works for you, I\u2019m ready to finalize immediately. If not, I understand, and we will look at our other candidates."", ""Round 4.2 - The Candidate: OPTION A: Continue Negotiation\n\nI appreciate the reset and hear you on keeping this collaborative. Thank you again for green\u2011lighting the Q4, 3\u2011month DC rotation, the August 12 start, New Haven as the primary office, and an office\u2011first setup. Those terms work for me and I\u2019m aligned on locking them in.\n\nIf we can land one of the following, I\u2019m ready to sign today:\n\nOption 1 (simple comp lift)\n- Base salary: $170,000\n- Signing bonus: $35,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Start: August 12\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC in Q4, then return to New Haven\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n\nOption 2 (balance base with a touch more time off)\n- Base salary: $165,000\n- Signing bonus: $35,000\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Start: August 12\n- Blair rotation: 3 months in DC in Q4, then return to New Haven\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n\nIf 2 weeks of vacation is truly fixed and $170k is a stretch, I can also close at a $167,500 base with the rest unchanged.\n\nThese options respect your structure while keeping me energized to deliver quickly. If you can do either Option 1 or Option 2, I\u2019ll sign today."", ""Round 5.1 - The Recruiter: I appreciate you coming back with clean options and a clear intent to close. I want to be equally direct so we can bring this to a conclusion.\n\nWe\u2019ve already made several meaningful commitments on structure, including the August 12 start, New Haven as the primary office, an office-first setup, and approving the Q4 three-month Blair rotation. Those are real exceptions on our side and reflect how strongly we feel about your potential here.\n\nOn compensation, I don\u2019t have approval to move into the mid-to-high 160s or 170s on base. That range is outside what I can responsibly support for this role, even with tradeoffs elsewhere.\n\nHere is the highest base and best overall package I can approve, and it\u2019s intended as a final path to yes:\n\nStart date: August 12\nPrimary office: New Haven, CT\nBlair rotation: 3 months in DC in Q4, then return to New Haven\nBase salary: $155,000\nSigning bonus: $40,000\nRemote work: 0 days per week (office-first)\nVacation: 2 weeks\n\nThis preserves the structure you\u2019ve aligned on, meaningfully improves total first-year compensation, and stays within the constraints I\u2019m accountable to.\n\nAt this point, I need to close this conversation. I don\u2019t have additional flexibility to continue negotiating, so the next response I\u2019m looking for is simply yes or no. If this works for you, I\u2019m ready to finalize immediately.

I\u2019d like to get you set up for maximum impact right away, so let me put a complete package on the table that aligns with our Q3 plans and the areas of greatest need.\n\nHere\u2019s the offer I\u2019m proposing:\n- Start Date: July 5\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT (this is our highest-need marketing hub and where you\u2019ll have the biggest early impact)\n- Base Salary: $132,000\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week (we prioritize in-person mentorship and collaboration, especially in the first year)\n- Signing Bonus: $0\n- Vacation: 2 weeks annually\n- Blair Rotation: Not included\n\nContext:\n- New Haven is where your leadership will most immediately move the needle; it\u2019s also where onboarding and cross-functional partners are centered.\n- We\u2019ve seen that being on-site drives faster ramp and better team outcomes, which is why the role is set up as in-person.\n- On the Blair/DC rotation: that would require an August 1 or later start and a custom contract. Given our timelines and legal overhead, I\u2019d prefer to avoid building that in up front.\n\nI want this to work for you. Could you share:\n- Your top two priorities among location, start timing, base, bonus, remote flexibility, vacation, and any Blair/DC exposure?\n- Any hard constraints (e.g., must-start date, location limits)?\n\nIf there\u2019s a gap, I have some limited flexibility we can explore\u2014potentially a modest signing bonus or 1 remote day/week, and we could consider July 15 for start. Movement on salary toward $135k is something I can look at if we\u2019re aligned on New Haven, 2 weeks vacation, and an in-person cadence.\n\nHow does this land for you? What would you need to feel great saying yes today?"", ""Round 1.2 - The Candidate: Hi there, I hope you are well. Thank you for sharing your offer. My top priority would be to work on the Blair rotation. If we could make this happen that would be the best for me and my experience and since I have a deep interest in government, I feel i could be extremely valuable to the company in DC. Also, I heard from multiple friends that secured similar positions as Director of Online Marketing at a similar firms for $175,000 - $200,000 plus bonus. I believe that range might be a little excessive, but I am curious about why there is such a difference between that position and this one. Would you mind sharing the range you have for the position and see if we cannot get closer to that range? I know its not your problem but I don't want to be embarrassed with my friends by saying I accepted an offer with such a wonderful firm and yet have such a low salary and bonus. Finally, i would prefer to work in Philadelphia, but I am happy with New Haven as long as the other conditions are met. Thanks!"", ""Round 2.1 - The Recruiter: I really appreciate you laying out your priorities. Let me tackle the two big ones you raised\u2014Blair/DC exposure and compensation\u2014and put a stronger package on the table.\n\nOn Blair/DC exposure:\n- The formal 3\u2011month DC rotation won\u2019t work in the initial contract. It requires an August 1+ start and custom legal work, and we need you ramped in Q3.\n- What I can commit to instead is structured access: monthly 1:1s with Blair for your first six months, plus planned short DC trips to work with that team on priority projects. You\u2019ll get the mentorship and visibility without delaying your start.\n\nOn compensation and market comparisons:\n- Our Director band here is generally in the $135\u2013$145k base range. Differences you\u2019re hearing (e.g., $175\u2013$200k) often reflect broader scope, different markets, or heavier equity/variable structures.\n- I can move the cash up meaningfully today while keeping the role aligned with our structure.\n\nRevised package I\u2019m proposing:\n- Start Date: July 5\n- Location: New Haven, CT (where you\u2019ll have the biggest early impact)\n- Base Salary: $134,000\n- Signing Bonus: $5,000\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week (we rely on in\u2011person leadership and mentorship, especially early)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks annually\n- Blair Rotation: Not included in the contract; instead, the structured Blair exposure plan above\n\nIf we align on New Haven, July 5, an in\u2011person cadence, 2 weeks vacation, and no formal 3\u2011month DC rotation, I can lock in $134,000 base + $5,000 sign\u2011on today.\n\nA couple of quick checks so I can close this out for you:\n- Is the 3\u2011month DC rotation a must\u2011have to accept, or would the structured access to Blair meet your goal?\n- If compensation is the last barrier under these terms, what exact base and sign\u2011on would let you say yes today?\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable with this package as is, we can move straight to paperwork."", ""Round 2.2 - The Candidate: Hi there. Thank you for your response. I feel the Blair rotation is a win-win for me and the company and I cannot in good conscience let myself not have the opportunity to shine at your company and make the biggest impact possible. My time in DC will be well worth the extra headache of paperwork and the return of my work will allow me to progress very quickly and drive massive impact for your firm. \n\nFor salary, I must ask whether you prefer me to have $190,000, no bonus, and 2 weeks vacation, $165,000, $35,000 bonus and 3 weeks vacation, or $175,000, $10,000 bonus and 4 weeks vacation? I feel that since I am not going to work in my preferred location of Philadelphia, I would need a little more compensation. Also, I would like to brag to the community about how great a place C&C is to work and these compensation packages would easily allow me to do so."", ""Round 3.1 - The Recruiter: I hear you on both fronts: wanting real time with Blair in DC and wanting a comp package you can feel great about. Let me be straight\u2014your three comp options are well outside our Director structure here, and the formal 3\u2011month DC rotation would push your start to August 1+ and slow down critical Q3 work. I can\u2019t put that rotation in the initial contract.\n\nHere\u2019s the strongest package I can approve now that aligns with our business needs and gives you meaningful DC exposure:\n\n- Start Date: July 5\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT (highest-need hub; core partners on-site)\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Signing Bonus: $10,000 (paid on first payroll)\n- Remote Work: 0 days/week (on-site leadership and mentorship are key in year one)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks annually\n- Blair Rotation: Not in the contract\n- Instead: Structured access to Blair\u2014monthly 1:1s for your first 6 months, plus two 2\u2011day working trips to DC in that window on priority initiatives. After you\u2019re ramped and delivering (around months 9\u201312), we can formally revisit a short DC secondment based on business needs and performance.\n\nIf the rotation itself is an absolute must-have on Day 1, we likely can\u2019t meet that need given the August start requirement and legal overhead. If your core goal is meaningful mentorship and exposure, the plan above delivers it without delaying your impact.\n\nIf I get this package approved as stated, can you say yes today? If you need a touch more runway on timing, I can make July 15 work on the same terms\u2014but I\u2019d like to lock the agreement now."", ""Round 3.2 - The Candidate: Thank you for your note. Unfortunately, if you cannot come close to the compensation packages I proposed, and I cannot take part in the Blair rotation, and I cannot work in Philadelphia, I cannot accept your offer.

You\u2019ll spend August on-site in New Haven to onboard with your core teams, then be full-time in DC for the rotation per company travel policy.\n\nWhy this works:\n- You get the full DC rotation, formally in the contract.\n- We keep you anchored in New Haven\u2014the highest-need hub\u2014so your post-rotation impact is maximized.\n- The comp structure puts more cash in your pocket now via the sign-on while keeping base aligned with our Director band.\n\nIf compensation is the only remaining gap under these terms, I can increase the signing bonus to $20,000 if we can get a signed acceptance this week.\n\nIf I put this exact package in writing with the formal DC rotation (Sep\u2013Nov) and Aug onboarding in New Haven, can you accept today?

We\u2019re genuinely excited about you joining and want to set you up to hit the ground running. Given the team\u2019s slate of launches and mentorship plans, here\u2019s the standard leadership package I\u2019m prepared to put on the table today:\n\n- Start date: July 5\n- Work location: New Haven, CT (marketing hub and highest-impact seat for this role)\n- Base salary: $134,000\n- Signing bonus: $0\n- Remote work: 0 days/week (in-office leadership presence for mentorship and onboarding)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: None (we can explore collaboration touchpoints without a formal DC rotation)\n\nRationale in brief:\n- New Haven is where your cross-functional partners and key programs live\u2014your impact is greatest there.\n- July 5 lets you join our Q3 planning cycle and get the full onboarding cohort experience.\n- We ask leaders to be on-site to model culture and develop the team.\n- We keep vacations tight at the leadership level right now to maintain delivery continuity.\n\nI want to be responsive to what matters most to you. If we can align on New Haven and 2 weeks\u2019 vacation, I have some flexibility in how we shape total comp (for example, base vs. one-time sign-on) and can discuss a measured approach on remote presence.\n\nA couple of quick questions to guide us:\n- Which two items here are most important to you?\n- How are you thinking about location/remote versus mentorship and team-building?\n- On compensation, do you prefer more in base or more as a one-time sign-on?\n\nAlso flagging: a formal 3-month DC rotation with Blair would push your start to August and require a special contract; for year one, we strongly favor you embedded in New Haven. Happy to revisit collaboration options with Blair once you\u2019re established.\n\nHow does this initial package land with you?"", ""Round 1.2 - The Candidate: Hi, thank you. I\u2019m genuinely excited about this role and very glad to hear the team feels the same. I\u2019m confident we can land on a structure that lets me contribute at full strength from day one! \n\nTo your question about what matters most, there are two items that are essential on my side:\nFirst, an August 1st start date, which is the earliest I can realistically begin and also ensures I\u2019m fully focused and ramped when I join.\nSecond, a competitive compensation package that reflects the scope of the role, including both base salary and signing support.\n\nI\u2019m quite flexible on location and remote structure, and New Haven can certainly work, especially since it seems to be where the organization sees the greatest impact for this role. I\u2019m also very interested in opportunities to work closely with senior leadership, including Blair\u2019s group, if the timing aligns.\n\nGiven this, I\u2019d love to explore a revised structure that keeps the July 5 date flexible and moves base salary and signing bonus more in line with the level of responsibility we\u2019ve discussed. I\u2019m confident we can get to a package that supports both the business needs and a strong start for me."", ""Round 2.1 - The Recruiter: I appreciate the clarity. Thank you for laying out what matters most.\n\nI can meet your August 1 start. In exchange, I\u2019d like to lock in the structure that sets you up for impact in New Haven and keeps our leadership norms intact. Here\u2019s a revised package I can move forward with today:\n\n- Start date: August 1\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Signing bonus: $10,000 (paid at start)\n- Remote work: 0 days/week (on-site leadership presence for onboarding and mentorship)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: None (instead, we\u2019ll line up early exposure\u2014monthly leadership touchpoints and a scoped collaboration with Blair\u2019s team in Q3/Q4 once you\u2019re settled)\n\nThis aligns to your start-date constraint and provides a meaningful first-year cash boost via the sign-on while keeping your base positioned for our normal year-end merit cycle.\n\nIf the only remaining gap is first-year cash, I\u2019d prefer to address that through a modest adjustment to the signing bonus rather than increasing base. If we can agree on New Haven, 0 remote, 2 weeks, and no formal rotation, I can be a bit flexible on the sign-on to close.\n\nIf this package works, I can get paperwork started today. Does this meet your needs so we can lock it in?"", ""Round 2.2 - The Candidate: Thank you for the thoughtful revision. The alignment on the August 1 start is really helpful, and I\u2019m comfortable anchoring the role in New Haven with an on-site structure.\n\nTo feel fully set up for success in this transition, I would need two adjustments:\n\nFirst, first-year compensation:\nSince base is tied to the annual merit cycle, it would make a meaningful difference to bring the signing bonus closer to the $30,000\u2013$40,000 range. That would ensure first-year cash reflects the scope of the Director role and supports relocation and ramp-up.\n\nBased on my research and experience, I\u2019m targeting a base salary in the $175\u2013185K range. That said, I\u2019m flexible on the exact split between base and bonus as long as the overall compensation package reflects the level of responsibility and enables a strong start.\n\nSecond, time to recharge before onboarding:\nGiven the intensity of the past cycle, 4 weeks of vacation (or even 3.5 weeks) would make a major difference in ensuring I\u2019m rested and fully focused when I start. Two weeks would be tough for me at this stage.\n\nI\u2019m flexible on the location, remote structure, and handling leadership exposure informally rather than through a formal rotation, as long as we can strengthen compensation and vacation to reflect the level of the role.\n\nIf we can align on those two areas, I\u2019m confident we can close quickly."", ""Round 3.1 - The Recruiter: Appreciate the clarity. Here\u2019s how I can structure this to respect your August 1 timing and set you up for impact while staying aligned with our leadership norms:\n\nProposed package:\n- Start date: August 1\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000 (top of band for initial placement)\n- Signing bonus: $30,000 (paid at start)\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Blair rotation: None (we\u2019ll line up monthly leadership touchpoints and a scoped collaboration with Blair\u2019s team once you\u2019re settled)\n\nThis gives you strong first\u2011year cash via the sign\u2011on, maintains on\u2011site leadership presence, and modestly extends vacation while keeping us within internal equity.\n\nIf your remaining sticking point is vacation length, I have one alternative trade-off:\n- 3.0 weeks of vacation with a $25,000 signing bonus (all other terms unchanged).\n\nIf we can align on the primary package (Aug 1 / New Haven / $135k base / $30k sign-on / 0 remote / 2.5 weeks / no formal Blair rotation), are you comfortable saying yes today so I can issue the offer? If not, would the 3.0 weeks + $25k sign-on variant close it for you?"", ""Round 3.2 - The Candidate: I appreciate the thoughtful clarity. The August 1 start, the strengthened sign-on, and the willingness to expand vacation are all helpful steps.\n\nThe one area I still need us to address is the base salary. A starting point of $135,000 is significantly below market for Director-level online marketing roles, especially given the scope we\u2019ve discussed. Even with a strong sign-on, that base level makes it difficult to ensure the compensation reflects the responsibility of the role.\n\nIf we can bring the base into a more appropriate range, even something in the $160K+ band to start, I can be flexible on the other items, including vacation length and the lack of a formal Blair rotation.\n\nFor example, something like:\n\nBase salary: around $160,000 / Signing bonus: $30,000 / Vacation: 3.0 to 3.5 weeks\n\nAll other terms, as proposed, would allow me to say yes today.\n\nI\u2019m excited about the team and the impact this role can have. If we can get the base closer to where it needs to be, I\u2019m ready to finalize this."", ""Round 4.1 - The Recruiter: I hear you on base. I\u2019ve pushed as far as I can internally and need to hold the line on initial placement to protect equity across the leadership team. The cleanest way I can meet your first\u2011year cash need is via a stronger sign\u2011on, while keeping the structure that sets you up for impact in New Haven.\n\nHere\u2019s my best package to close today:\n- Start date: August 1\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Signing bonus: $35,000 (paid at start)\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Blair rotation: None (we\u2019ll set up monthly LT touchpoints and a scoped collaboration with Blair\u2019s team in Q3/Q4)\n\nThis gives you robust first\u2011year cash while keeping the role embedded with your cross\u2011functional partners and preserving leadership norms. It also aligns to what you said works on location, on\u2011site presence, and no formal rotation.\n\nIf we align on this structure now, are you comfortable saying yes so I can issue the offer today?"", ""Round 4.2 - The Candidate: Thank you for laying this out clearly. I appreciate the flexibility on the sign-on, though I want to be transparent about what would truly make this work for me.\n\nWhile the stronger signing bonus helps with first-year cash, the base salary remains the key issue. At $135,000, it sits well below market for a Director-level online marketing role, and below what would make sense for me to take on the scope.\n\nI\u2019m actually not urgent about front-loaded cash, I would much prefer a cleaner compensation structure with a stronger base, even if that means a lower sign-on. Something closer to $170,000 in base salary would put the role in a sustainable place for me and align with the level of responsibility we\u2019ve discussed.\n\nSeparately, if we move forward without a Blair rotation, I would need 3.5\u20134 weeks of vacation to ensure the move to New Haven is balanced and sustainable long-term.\n\nSo a structure like:\n\nBase salary around $170,000/ Signing bonus adjusted as needed/ 3.5\u20134 weeks vacation\n\nOr we can do Base salary: $145,000 / Signing bonus: $40,000 as needed/ 3-3.5 weeks vacation\n\nAll other terms as proposed.

I appreciate the movement on the sign-on and the alignment on the start date and structure.\n\nGiven that the base salary is fixed at $135,000, which I understand may be a hard ceiling for this placement, the remaining area I need to feel fully supported is vacation.\n\nTo make the transition sustainable, especially with the move to New Haven and no formal rotation, a 3.5\u20134 week vacation allocation would put the package in a place where I can say yes today.\nAlternatively, if we keep the vacation at 2.5 weeks, incorporating the formal Blair rotation would also make the overall structure work.\n\nIf we can align on that adjustment, I\u2019m comfortable moving forward and finalizing the offer now."", ""Round 6.1 - The Recruiter: I appreciate you laying out exactly what would make this work.

So happy to be here today. I have a few questions to start with:\n\n1. What is a normal range of salary do you offer (25th, 75th, 90th percentile for example)?\n2. I really want us to both have a deal that we like (to maximize the pie), so I would like you to know my top concerns. Salary and bonus aside, my top priorities are the start date, vacation weeks, and whether I could work with Blair for a rotation. I'd like to know what issues are your top concerns and whether anything is non-negotiable, also what things are your least concerns (i.e. you're very flexible)\n3. I'd like to express that I understand that the company gives out a maximum of 40000 signing bonus. While I really would like that, between, let's say 40000 bonus and 25000 more salary, I'd much prefer having more salary going forward. Of course if you have a completely opposite preference, we can work out the specific number."", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: Thanks for laying out your priorities\u2014that\u2019s helpful.\n\nOn your questions:\n1) Salary ranges: For this Director role, our current base salary band is approximately $135,000\u2013$145,000. Roughly speaking, the 25th percentile sits near $135k, the median around $140k, and the upper end/75th near $145k. The very top end (90th) is essentially the top of that band and only used in rare cases.\n\n2) Our priorities and flexibility:\n- Top priorities: New Haven as the work location (that team is scaling), a July onboarding (ideally July 5th to align with our cohort), and strong in\u2011office presence for leadership/mentorship.\n- On Blair: We can\u2019t commit to a 3\u2011month DC rotation for this role this cycle. I can explore ways to get you exposure to Blair\u2019s workstreams, but a formal 3\u2011month rotation in DC isn\u2019t something we can support for this position right now.\n- Flexibility: We can be flexible on start date within July (July 15th if needed), and on the mix between base and a one\u2011time sign\u2011on (within our cap). For remote, our preference is fully in-office, but I can consider a light cadence if the rest of the package aligns.\n\n3) Salary vs. bonus: I hear you. We aim to keep base within band and use sign\u2011on to smooth transitions. If we align on location/in\u2011person/start, I\u2019m comfortable steering more toward a modest sign\u2011on rather than pushing base above band.\n\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s a full package I can stand behind as a starting point:\n- Start date: July 5th\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote work: 0 day(s) / week\n- Signing bonus: $5,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal rotation (we\u2019ll facilitate touchpoints with Blair\u2019s org)\n\nA few quick questions so I can tune this to what matters most to you:\n- Is the 3\u2011month Blair rotation a must\u2011have, or would structured exposure (e.g., participation in quarterly DC strategy reviews and joint projects) meet your goals?\n- How many vacation weeks are you hoping for?\n- Any hard constraints on start date (could July 5th work, or is July 15th necessary)?\n- Are you open to New Haven as your home office?\n- What in\u2011office vs. remote cadence would you ideally like?\n\nIf we can align on New Haven, July onboarding, and largely in\u2011person presence, I have room to enhance the sign\u2011on within our limits."", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Thank you for the offer but honestly this is way below my expectations:\n\nI'm relatively flexible on remote work, so I can happily cooperate to work in office. New Haven is absolutely not my top choice, but as it is your no.1 priority, I could accommodate as well. In return, I expect you to let me win on some of my priorities.\n\nJust so you know, if you could offer \nAug 1st or later start date, 4 weeks vacation, 0 remote days, a 3-month blair rotation, New Haven as home office, 145000 salary and a 40000 signing bonus, I'd sign right now!\n\nMeanwhile, I want to confirm: what i mean by Blair rotation is the 3 months rotation in DC, anything otherwise isn't the same to me. Could you confirm with me whether that is 100% off the table?\nSame with Aug 1st or later start date, is it completely off the table or you could potentially accommodate with a less salary?"", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: I really appreciate how clearly you\u2019ve laid out your priorities, and thank you for the flexibility on New Haven and on being in\u2011office. Let me be equally clear on our guardrails so we can get to a deal quickly.\n\nDirect answers to your questions:\n- 3\u2011month Blair rotation: For this role, this cycle, a formal 3\u2011month DC rotation is not available. That\u2019s a firm no. We can arrange structured exposure to Blair\u2019s workstreams (quarterly DC strategy reviews, joint initiatives, and periodic mentorship touchpoints), but not a 3\u2011month DC stint.\n- Aug 1+ start: We need a July start to align with our onboarding and Q3 plan. I can flex from July 5th to July 15th, but August 1+ isn\u2019t something I can approve for this position.\n\nGiven your willingness to be in\u2011office and to base in New Haven, here\u2019s an improved package I can approve today:\n- Start date: July 15th\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote work: 0 day(s) / week\n- Signing bonus: $10,000\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal rotation (we\u2019ll facilitate structured exposure to Blair\u2019s org)\n\nWhy this works: It keeps you in the July onboarding wave for maximum impact, maintains strong in\u2011person leadership presence, and recognizes your value with both cash (base + sign\u2011on) and added time off relative to our initial offer.\n\nIf you can confirm alignment on:\n- New Haven as home office\n- 0 remote days/week\n- No Blair rotation\n- July 15th start\n- 2.5 weeks vacation\n- $135k base with a $10k sign\u2011on\n\n\u2026I can lock this in immediately.

I want to understand a few things:\n\n1. If I do everything you want (July 5th, 2 weeks vacation, 0 remote, no Blair rotation, New haven), What's the maximum package could you give me? I want you to understand, if you're giving your current offer, there's no deal and I'll walk away immediately. Anything above 145k + 40k bonus or 155k + 20k bonus can bring me back to the table but i'll still be just taking a crumb. I understand that market rate is between 145k to 155k and I have even better quality than average. I want to understand why you're blocking me on the salary.\n\n2. Outside all issues we've discussed, is there anything else you could offer me to compensate for this small salary? For example, trip fund, remote weeks (different from remote days of a week), housing subsidy, etc.\n\n3. I want to understand what you'd do if you don't hire me."", ""Round 4.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate the candor. Let me answer your questions directly and move us toward a concrete close.\n\n1) \u201cIf I do everything you want, what\u2019s the maximum package?\u201d\n- Here is the best cash package I can approve today if you align to our priorities (New Haven, in\u2011office, no Blair rotation, July onboarding, 2 weeks vacation):\n  - Start date: July 5th (strong preference; I can honor July 15th if absolutely needed)\n  - Work location: New Haven, CT\n  - Base salary: $135,000\n  - Remote: 0 day(s) / week\n  - Signing bonus: $30,000 (paid in first payroll; can split if you prefer)\n  - Vacation: 2 weeks\n  - Blair rotation: No (we\u2019ll facilitate structured exposure to Blair\u2019s org)\n\nThat puts your year\u2011one cash at $165,000 before any performance bonus or merit cycle, plus benefits.\n\nWhy not increase base? We maintain tight internal equity at the Director level and bring new Directors in consistent with the current cohort; we use a one\u2011time sign\u2011on to bridge transitions and then true\u2011up through the early performance/merit process. I can also commit to an accelerated compensation review at 6 months with eligibility for a base adjustment based on impact.\n\nIf July 15th is necessary, I can keep the above package exactly the same; my strong preference is July 5th to stay aligned with cohort onboarding.\n\n2) Other ways to offset salary\nWithin policy, I can add:\n- Relocation/temporary housing support: up to 30 days corporate housing or a relocation stipend\n- Professional development: dedicated budget for one external conference plus courses/certifications in your first year\n- Executive mentorship: guaranteed quarterly strategy touchpoints with Blair\u2019s org and DC leadership, plus executive coaching sessions in H1\n- Work\u2011from\u2011anywhere flexibility: one week in your first year (separate from day\u2011to\u2011day in\u2011office cadence)\n\nThese don\u2019t change base, but they increase your first\u2011year value and career trajectory.\n\n3) If we don\u2019t hire you\nWe do have strong finalists we could move forward with. That said, you\u2019re our first choice for this role, and I\u2019m putting meaningful cash on the table to make this work now.\n\nHere\u2019s my ask so we can finish this today:\n- If I put the package below in writing, can you sign today?\n  - July 5th start (July 15th if you truly need it)\n  - New Haven, CT\n  - $135,000 base\n  - $30,000 sign\u2011on\n  - 0 remote days/week\n  - 2 weeks vacation\n  - No Blair rotation\n\nIf you can\u2019t say yes to that, please give me one number: the exact signing bonus that would close today with base fixed at $135k, New Haven, 0 remote, 2 weeks vacation, and a July start (5th preferred, 15th acceptable). If there\u2019s a narrow gap, I\u2019ll see if I can bridge it right now."", ""Round 5.1 - The Candidate: I recognize that you value my preference to start on July 15 and offered the same package aside from the start date. I'd also love to have all benefits you are offering, especially the housing support and one week work-from-anywhere flexibility.\n\nUnfortunately, what you offered (even with July 15th) is outside my scope.\n\nI'd like to make three offers:\nall with July 15th start date, 0 remote days, no Blair rotation, New Haven as the home office\n\nOffer 1: 2.5 weeks vacation + 145k+30k bonus\nOffer 2: 3.5 weeks vacation + 135k+40k bonus\nOffer 3: 3 weeks vacation +142k +30k bonus\n\nI think that you should recognize all the concessions I've made. I'm accommodating to all the needs within the team and tried to work on the number. I know that vacation days are less valuable to you than cash, and please understand that anything significant below this number, I'll walk away. I'm only at the table because I think you're near your limit as well, while I'm definitely at mine."", ""Round 5.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate how transparent you\u2019ve been and the flexibility you\u2019ve shown on New Haven, in\u2011office, and no Blair rotation. I also hear you on total cash. Let me be crystal clear on where I can and cannot go so we can close this.\n\nWhat I can\u2019t do:\n- Increase base above band for this role (so not $142k or $145k)\n- Increase vacation beyond 2 weeks for this Director slot\n\nHere are two close\u2011now options I can approve today. If you pick either, I\u2019ll get the letter out immediately.\n\nOption A (optimize onboarding + higher sign\u2011on):\n- Start date: July 5th\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote: 0 day(s) / week\n- Signing bonus: $32,500 (paid in first payroll; can split if you prefer)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No\n\nOption B (your preferred date):\n- Start date: July 15th\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote: 0 day(s) / week\n- Signing bonus: $30,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No\n\nIncluded in both, day one:\n- Relocation support (up to 30 days corporate housing or stipend)\n- One week work\u2011from\u2011anywhere in year one\n- Professional development budget (conference + courses/certifications)\n- Structured executive mentorship and quarterly strategy touchpoints with Blair\u2019s org\n\nIf neither Option A nor B works, give me one number: the exact signing bonus that would close today with base fixed at $135k, vacation at 2 weeks, New Haven, 0 remote, and a July start. If it\u2019s within reach, I will try to make it happen in our final round."", ""Round 6.1 - The Candidate: I think you're lying to me - you just said that 145k was within range for top candidates, and you offered 2.5 weeks of vacation to me.\n\nPlease be truly honest with me.

The team is excited about the fit. To get us moving toward a complete agreement, I\u2019d like to propose a full-package starting point that aligns with our Q3 launch and onboarding cadence, and then hear what matters most to you so we can tune it.\n\nHere\u2019s the package I\u2019m proposing to anchor our discussion:\n- Start date: July 5\n- Work location: New Haven, CT (home base with your leadership presence on site)\n- Base salary: $132,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week (executive presence and mentorship are core for this role)\n- Signing bonus: $3,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal 3\u2011month DC rotation (we can still arrange periodic touchpoints with Blair and the DC team through project work and short visits)\n\nBusiness rationale:\n- July 5 lines you up with our Q3 digital campaigns and the new martech onboarding window.\n- New Haven is where the growth team, data partners, and creative resources you\u2019ll lead sit\u2014your in-person presence is a big multiplier for outcomes and mentorship.\n- Keeping the role primarily on site reflects how our senior leaders run their teams.\n\nA couple of quick questions to tailor this to you:\n- Are there any constraints on New Haven as your home base or a July 5 start?\n- If we keep New Haven + July 5 + no formal DC rotation, which two items on the package are most important for you to improve (e.g., base, signing, remote flexibility, vacation)?\n\nIf we can align on location and start, I can focus our flexibility on the two priorities you name and work the numbers accordingly. How does this land for you?"", ""Round 1.2 - The Candidate: Hi, thank you for the offer! The Director of Online Marketing role sounds very interesting and I really hope we can make the package work.\n\nThat said, the current offer is unfortunately very far off from what I envisioned and from what my market research on the compensation structure of similar roles has shown. Before making a proposal, it would therefore be helpful for me to precisely understand the following:\n\n- How and in which order do you value the following (and importantly also why): Start date, work location, base salary, remote work, signing bonus, vacation, blair rotation? Essentially, I would like to get a feel about which issues are most important to you so I can see whether this aligns with my plans.\n- Please tell me for which issues you have the most flexibility and which the least.\n- For base salary, it would be good to get a range in which you are authorized to operate in. My market research has shown quite substantially higher salary bands for similar roles but for people less qualified.\n\nThe following would make sense to me:\n\nProposal 1 (gives you exactly what you asked for: New Haven, July 5, no blair rotation, and I even agree to 0 remote work)\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Blair rotation: No\n- Start date: July 5\n- Base salary: 212,000\n- Remote work policy: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: 40,000\n- Vacation time: 4 weeks\n\nProposal 2 \n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Blair rotation: Yes\n- Start date: August 1st or later\n- Base salary: 192,000\n- Remote work policy: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: 40,000\n- Vacation time: 4 weeks\n\nProposal 3\n- Location: Philadelphia, PA\n- Blair rotation: No\n- Start date: July 15\n- Base salary: 208,500\n- Remote work policy: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: 40,000\n- Vacation time: 2 weeks\n\n Out of these three, which is most likely something that you could approve?"", ""Round 2.1 - The Recruiter: Appreciate the thoughtful packages\u2014and we\u2019re genuinely excited about you joining. Let me be transparent so we can converge quickly.\n\nWhat matters most to us (in order), with brief why:\n- New Haven, CT as home base: This team\u2019s leadership, data partners, and creative engine sit there; your on\u2011site presence is critical to outcomes and mentorship.\n- July 5 start: Aligns with our Q3 launch and martech onboarding window.\n- In\u2011person leadership: 0 remote days/week for this role.\n- Vacation at 2 weeks to start: We\u2019re in a heavy build cycle and need leadership time in the room.\n- No formal 3\u2011month Blair rotation this year: It requires an August 1+ start and would delay core priorities. We can facilitate project work and short DC visits instead.\n- Compensation: We\u2019ll keep base within our director band and use a modest sign\u2011on to smooth the landing.\n\nFlexibility summary:\n- Least flexible: New Haven home base, 0 remote, 2 weeks vacation, no 3\u2011month Blair rotation, July 5 start preferred.\n- Some flexibility: If absolutely necessary, July 15 can work once everything else is locked.\n- Most flexible (within band): Compensation\u2014primarily via signing bonus, with limited room on base.\n\nSalary authorization range:\n- For this Director scope, internal equity puts base in the low\u2013mid 130s. I have approval authority up to $135,000 on base.\n\nOn your three proposals:\n- As written, none are approvable. Proposal 3 is directionally closer on vacation/remote, but the Philly location and $208.5k base are non\u2011starters for us.\n\nHere\u2019s a package I can support and move to approval quickly. If we lock these non\u2011cash terms:\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Start date: July 5\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No (we\u2019ll do periodic DC touchpoints via projects/short visits)\n\nThen I can offer you two compensation configurations\u2014pick the one that fits your priorities:\n- Option A (higher sign\u2011on): Base $132,000 + $10,000 signing bonus\n- Option B (higher base): Base $135,000 + $3,000 signing bonus\n\nBetween base and sign\u2011on, which matters more to you? And can we confirm New Haven + July 5 + 0 remote + 2 weeks + no formal Blair rotation are acceptable so we can finalize on one of the two compensation options?"", ""Round 2.2 - The Candidate: Thank you for this and providing clarification! This helps me to understand what you value and where you have flexibility. \n\nUnfortunately, the non-cash terms do not work if you are capped on the base and signing bonus as you present. If the non-cash terms are truly as inflexible as you say, then the compensation (salary and signing bonus) must be substantially higher to compensate for that. And if you are truly capped on base at 135,000, both proposals you have provided put me substantially below my market value (considering my 5 years of experience and education in the field). Generally, I want to be honest: New Haven, July 5 start, 2 week vacation only and 0 remote are an incredibly straining structure on my end. If these are inflexible, then I'm afraid we are too far apart as of now.\n\nSpeaking with Blair during my second round interview, he confirmed to me that you give out signing bonuses of 40,000. But even if we get to 40,000, if you are not willing to go higher on base or adapt some non-cash items, the offer is still unfortunately unattractive. Further, the possibility to do a 3 month rotation in DC with Blair was a very attractive feature while Philadelphia was my preferred choice for office. Similarly, I heard that your company culture values \""work-life balance\"" and 2 week vacation I'm afraid does not really reflect this in my eyes.\n\nThat said, I want to make this work, so please come stronger in my direction as I'm willing to compromise. I'm presenting you with three offers below which I could accept and I believe I'm coming a large bit in your direction and it would be great if you could do the same:\n\nProposal 1: \n- Location: New Haven, CT (what you want)\n- Blair rotation: No (what you want)\n- Start date: July 5 (what you want)\n- Base salary: 193,000 (simply compensating)\n- Remote work policy: 0 days/week (what you want)\n- Signing bonus: 40,000 (what Blair claimed)\n- Vacation time: 3 weeks (falling in line with your work life balance culture)\n\nHereby, I'm giving you directly four of the issues (the majority) exactly as you want them while giving up on them (and loosing a lot of value for me). The signing bonus simply follows what Blair told me and the compensation makes up for giving up all preferences. Even if this is higher than the bandwidth, the additional value that this company will generate under me in this position will be substantially higher than the extra 58,000 you pay me. After all, there is a reason why you are interviewing me and I want this company to be equally as invested in me as I am in you. The 1 extra week of vacation reflects you work-life balance claim, will not change how well I perform, and likely falls in line with others in the organization. Give me the go and lets sign on this right now.\n\nProposal 2: \n- Location: New Haven, CT (what you want)\n- Blair rotation: Yes \n- Start date: August 1st or later \n- Base salary: 177,000 (substantially lowering my ask)\n- Remote work policy: 0 days/week (what you want)\n- Signing bonus: 40,000 (what Blair claimed)\n- Vacation time: 2 weeks (what you want)\n\nThis allows me to do the DC stint and return to New Haven afterwards. As the stint is only 3 months, I believe this one-time opportunity is a greater win for you in the long-run, considering the motivation and network I will derive from this creates a long-term lock in.\n\nProposal 3: \n- Location: New Haven, CT (what you want)\n- Blair rotation: No \n- Start date: July 15\n- Base salary: 183,500 (substantially lowering my ask)\n- Remote work policy: 0 days/week (what you want)\n- Signing bonus: 40,000 (what Blair claimed)\n- Vacation time: 3.5 weeks\n\nThis option may be a good compromise, as I will be present at all times in New Haven without any DC with a lowered salary ask, the bonus Blair put forward and a slightly higher vacation time for the work-life balance. \n\nIf you say yes to one of these three right now, I will sign right now and lets get to work."", ""Round 3.1 - The Recruiter: I appreciate how clearly you\u2019ve laid out your priorities and the flexibility you\u2019ve shown. I can\u2019t approve any of your three packages as written due to internal equity, leadership coverage needs, and our Q3 build timeline. That said, I\u2019m prepared to meet you where you\u2019ve been most consistent: the full signing bonus.\n\nHere\u2019s the package I can finalize today and move to a written offer immediately:\n- Start date: July 5\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (paid on your first eligible payroll after start)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal 3\u2011month DC rotation this year\n\nTo support your Blair interest and professional growth without delaying Q3:\n- We\u2019ll structure quarterly DC touchpoints with Blair (two 2\u2011day immersions in the first 6\u20139 months) and align you to Gov\u2019t Affairs-linked campaigns.\n- 6\u2011month performance and compensation check\u2011in (in addition to the annual cycle) to calibrate scope and pay as you ramp.\n- Full relocation support to New Haven and executive coaching budget in year one.\n\nThis is the strongest I can do on compensation for this role today: we\u2019re meeting the full $40k sign-on you asked for, and keeping base at the top of my authority within the director band. Total first\u2011year cash is $175,000, with a clear path to expand scope and revisit compensation after impact is demonstrated.\n\nIf we align on this package\u2014New Haven + July 5 + 0 remote + 2 weeks + no formal Blair rotation, with $135,000 base and a $40,000 sign-on\u2014are you ready to accept today? If yes, I\u2019ll get the offer letter drafted before we leave this room.\n\nIf timing is your only remaining concern, I can move the start to July 15 with no other changes."", ""Round 3.2 - The Candidate: Thank you for this and coming a bit into my direction. Please in the first step list out your previous offer but with July 15 as a start before doing anything else. Based on your current offer, July 15 is an absolute necessity. I would just like to have it in draft to read it better. However, I'm still not really happy and believe me being happy would be essential to perform well, wouldn't you agree? \n\nSo, before finalizing anything, you mentioned that you have a pool for full relocation support to New Haven and executive coaching budget in year one. This is great to know and I believe gives us further flexibility and make us both happy. Considering that these perks are not valuable to me but have already been allocated for me for this purpose, I would like the funds for these perks to be re-allocated or rather simply renamed. As such, you don't actually break any salary ranges (considering that all other directors also receive this but it goes in their accounts not as salary but relocation and coaching budget). I have two proposals below which I would accept right now and you literally do not have to change anything except from renaming \""full relocation support to New Haven and executive coaching budget in year one\"" to base salary. I'm really keen to get this deal done:\n\nProposal 1: \n- Location: New Haven, CT (as discussed)\n- Blair rotation: No (as discussed)\n- Start date: July 15 (as discussed)\n- Base salary: 165,000 (simply re-allocate the \""full relocation support to New Haven and executive coaching budget in year one\"" - just call it base salary instead)\n- Remote work policy: 0 days/week (as discussed)\n- Signing bonus: 40,000 (as discussed)\n- Vacation time: 2 weeks (as discussed)\n\nThis is the option that gives both of us what we want without braking any salary ranges and achieving success. Please accept this Proposal 1 right now and we are all done and happy. \n\nProposal 2: \n- Location: New Haven, CT (as discussed)\n- Blair rotation: No (as discussed)\n- Start date: July 15 (as discussed)\n- Base salary: 157,000 (simply re-allocate the \""full relocation support to New Haven and executive coaching budget in year one\"" - divide it between base salary and my vacation time)\n- Remote work policy: 0 days/week (as discussed)\n- Signing bonus: 40,000 (as discussed)\n- Vacation time: 3 weeks (simply re-allocate the \""full relocation support to New Haven and executive coaching budget in year one\"" - divide it between base salary and my vacation time)\n\nOption 2 as an additional idea on how to re-allocate the funds to things that matter to me. \n\nLet's get this deal done."", ""Round 4.1 - The Recruiter: Absolutely\u2014per your request, here is the full package with the July 15 start date, exactly laid out:\n\n- Start date: July 15\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $40,000 (paid on first eligible payroll after start)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal 3\u2011month DC rotation this year\n\nA couple of clarifications on your reallocation idea: I can\u2019t convert or \u201crename\u201d relocation and executive coaching budgets into base salary or vacation\u2014those are separate programs with different accounting/tax treatment and are not fungible with base.

I'm equally excited about the potential to lead the online marketing team at C&C Biomedicals and make a significant impact, especially with the Q3 launch.\n\nYou've asked about my priorities and constraints. The two items that matter most to me are the Blair Rotation and the Start Date. The rotation represents a unique, career-changing opportunity in Government Affairs that I'm very keen on, and it necessitates a start date of August 1st or later. This timing also aligns with some prior personal commitments.\n\nGiven that, the proposed July 5th start in New Haven isn't feasible for me. I want to be set up for success from day one, and for me, that means being able to undertake this rotational experience.\n\nSo, I'd like to propose a revised package that aligns with both the organization's needs and my key priorities:\n\nStart Date: August 1st (enables the rotation)\nWork Location: Philadelphia, PA (This is crucial for me post-rotation, given my proximity and roots. It offers easy connectivity to HQ in New Haven when needed.)\nBlair Rotation: Included (A 3-month rotation in DC under Blair's supervision, as discussed)\nBase Salary: $165,000 (This reflects the market rate for this level of role and my experience)\nRemote Work: 0 days/week (I agree on the importance of in-person leadership and mentorship, especially post-rotation in Philadelphia)\nSigning Bonus: $40,000 (Given the relocation considerations and transition)\nVacation: 4 weeks (To ensure sustainable performance and work-life balance in a demanding role)\nThis structure allows me to immediately contribute to the DC initiatives, integrate deeply with Blair's team, and then transition permanently to lead the Online Marketing team from the Philadelphia office, fully present and engaged. I'm confident this sets us up for the greatest long-term impact.\n\nWhat would it take to make this framework work? I'm open to discussing the specific levers here to reach an agreement."", ""Round 2.1 - The Recruiter: I appreciate the clarity on your priorities. If the Blair rotation and an August 1 start are must-haves, we can accommodate both\u2014provided we lock in the structure that sets you and the business up for success immediately after the rotation.\n\nHere\u2019s a package I can put on the table now:\n\n- Start date: August 1 (to enable the Blair rotation)\n- Blair rotation: Included (3 months in DC)\n- Work location (post-rotation home base): New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $133,000\n- Signing bonus: $10,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week (executive standard)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n\nRationale:\n- Post-rotation, the Director role needs to be embedded at HQ in New Haven to lead the cross-functional build-out and mentor the team. That\u2019s a hard requirement for us.\n- Given the added complexity of the rotation and custom paperwork, we\u2019re keeping the base aligned to budget and using a sign-on to smooth the transition.\n- Two weeks PTO is the leadership norm here during this critical build phase; we revisit time-off flexibility after the first year through standard review.\n\nIf your strong preference for Philadelphia after the rotation is immovable, we can explore it\u2014but it would require a materially different compensation balance to make the business case work (think: base closer to $125,000 with a $0 sign-on, while keeping 2 weeks PTO and 0 remote).\n\nIf the main tension is base vs. bonus (not location), I can also reweight within our envelope: for example, we could look at base $135,000 with a $5,000 sign-on, keeping all other terms the same.\n\nIf we can align on New Haven as your home base after DC and 2 weeks PTO, I can lock the August 1 start and the Blair rotation today. How do you feel about this structure, and is base vs. bonus the key lever for you, or is post-rotation location the priority?""]",,

To get the ball rolling, here\u2019s a package that lets you hit the ground running and aligns with our biggest priorities:\n\n- Start date: July 5\n- Work location: New Haven, CT (our highest-need hub for marketing right now)\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote work: On-site, 0 days/week (with typical flexibility for travel, conferences, and occasional ad hoc needs)\n- Signing bonus: $0 to start; open to discuss a modest bonus if the rest of the package aligns\n- Vacation: 2 weeks PTO, complemented by our in-office perks (extended cafeteria, laundry service, wellness coaching)\n- Blair rotation: No formal 3-month DC rotation, but we\u2019ll facilitate meaningful exposure\u2014regular touchpoints with Blair\u2019s team, strategic project involvement, and planned DC visits as needed\n\nA few quick thoughts on the \u201cwhy\u201d behind this structure:\n- New Haven is where your leadership will have outsized impact across product, analytics, and sales.\n- An early July start gets you into the Q3 launch cycle and executive onboarding calendar.\n- In-person presence is critical for mentoring the team and accelerating brand initiatives.\n- Keeping base within band preserves long-term comp consistency; if we need to sweeten, I\u2019d rather do it with a one-time bonus than inflate base.\n\nI want this to work for you as well. To guide where I flex, can I ask:\n1) Of everything on the table, what are your top two priorities?\n2) How important is a formal Blair rotation versus getting substantive exposure to Blair and the DC team without delaying your start?\n3) If we adjust compensation, do you prefer dollars in base or a signing bonus?\n4) Any immovable constraints on timing, location, or remote needs I should know about?\n\nWhere I have targeted flexibility: we can consider a July 15 start, up to 1 remote day/week, and 2.5 weeks vacation if that helps us land an agreement\u2014ideally traded against keeping New Haven as the home base and avoiding a formal rotation."", ""Round 1.2 - The Candidate: Hi, thanks for sitting down with me. \n\n\nThe two items that are most important to me are salary (where I am looking for a number closer to $200,000) and singing bonus. If we can get to a good agreement on these, I believe we can find smart trades with the other issues. Between the two, I would prefer salary over signing bonus. \n\nI only value the formal Blair rotation. If we cannot make this work, substantive exposure is good but does not really help me with my goals. I know this would require a later start date (which I would prefer, too), but if we can agree on the other issues, I have some flexibility on this. Even without a Blair rotation, I would prefer July 15th to July 1st. \n\nI agree with you on remote work. I value leadership and mentorship in person, and if you preference on this is 0 days per week, we can agree on this rather easily as our preferences on this are aligned. \nAnd for PTO, I would prefer 2.5 weeks over 2 weeks. Ideally, even more, but this is not of the highest priority to me. \n\nIf New Haven is important to you, I am able to agree to this if we can sweeten the deal on other aspects. \n\nHow does this sound to you?\n\nConversely, what matters most to you? If you could tell me your top 3 preferences and how much they matter to you, we can make sure we each get what we care about most. \n\nIf there is anything else I should know, i.e., and immovable constraints on your side, I would also like to ask for you to share those with me now so we can make the rest of the negotiation as efficient as possible."", ""Round 2.1 - The Recruiter: Appreciate the clarity\u2014that helps. Here\u2019s a package I can get approved right now that leans into your preferences on timing and upfront cash while keeping our core guardrails intact:\n\n- Start date: July 15\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $135,000\n- Remote work: On-site, 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $22,500 (and I can increase this to $25,000 if you accept the full package as-is today)\n- Vacation: 2 weeks PTO\n- Blair rotation: No formal 3-month DC rotation\n\nWhy this structure:\n- Base: I need to keep base within band for equity across the org\u2014moving base higher isn\u2019t something I can do this cycle.\n- Start date: July 15 meets your preference for a later start and still keeps you aligned to our Q3 launch and exec onboarding.\n- Location and on-site presence: New Haven and in-person are must-haves on our side to maximize your impact out of the gate.\n- Blair: A formal rotation would push us to an August 1+ start and create real disruption right when we need you leading the team. We\u2019ll ensure meaningful exposure to Blair and the DC team, but not as a formal rotation.\n\nMy top priorities, so you have the lay of the land:\n1) New Haven home base and in-person leadership (must-have)\n2) Keep base within band (must-have)\n3) Early Q3 onboarding (strong preference)\n\nIf base and no formal rotation stand, the lever I\u2019m prepared to use to close is cash upfront: accept this package now and I\u2019ll bump the signing bonus to $25,000. If there\u2019s one specific tweak (other than base or a formal rotation) that would make this a yes today, tell me what it is and I\u2019ll see if I can land it."", ""Round 2.2 - The Candidate: Thank you for your offer and clarifications. Let me give you my feedback on this. \n\nI appreciate your flexibility on start date. I can make July 15 work also without a formal Blair rotation. \nRemote work 0 days a week is something we agree on. \nIf new haven is a non-negotiable for you, then that works too.\n\nHowever, this deal as of right now does not work for me.\n\nIf I agree to July 15th and New Haven, I would need more salary, a higher signing bonus, and more PTO. \n\nIdeally, I would be looking for something closer to $175k on salary, $50k signing bonus, and 4 weeks PTO as a starting point. \n\nIf you could tell me, what is the absolute max salary you can offer in band for equity across the organization? what is the best you can do on this? Every dollar more you could offer me would get me closer to being able to agree to the deal. \n\nIf I agree with you on New Haven as home base which is your top 1 priority and also agree to a early Q3 onboarding without a Blair rotation, even though I would prefer to start in august WITH a Blair rotation, where can you meet me on the other issues? Right now this is not a deal I would be able to accept and I would have to walk away from this if you cannot significantly improve your offer."", ""Round 3.1 - The Recruiter: Appreciate the candor. I went back to comp and stretched where I can while keeping our key guardrails intact. Here\u2019s the best-balanced package I can put on the table right now:\n\n- Start date: July 15\n- Work location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $140,000\n- Remote work: 0 days/week\n- Signing bonus: $30,000 (I\u2019ll increase this to $32,500 if you accept the full package as-is today)\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Blair rotation: No formal 3-month DC rotation\n\nWhy this works:\n- It puts you at the top of our practical range this cycle on base and pairs it with strong day-one cash.\n- Locks in leadership impact in New Haven and keeps you aligned to Q3 onboarding.\n- Preserves the in-person model we both value.\n\nOn your direct question about base: getting to $175k isn\u2019t possible this cycle. If base is the single lever you need higher, the furthest I can credibly go is mid-140s. If we lock New Haven, 0 remote, July 15, no formal rotation, and keep PTO at 2.5 weeks with the signing bonus at or under $30k, I can work to stretch base into the $142.5k\u2013$145k range. I\u2019d prefer to land at $140k base with the $30k signing (or $32.5k if you accept now).\n\nIf this package meets you where you need to be, we can shake hands today and I\u2019ll get paperwork out immediately. If it still misses, tell me which single lever matters more\u2014base versus day-one cash\u2014and I\u2019ll tune within these guardrails."", ""Round 3.2 - The Candidate: I appreciate your response and improved offer. \n\nAs we are getting closer to a deal I can agree to, I would be curious about the following: If $145,000 is truly the max you can do, I would still need some further improvement. Would you prefer to offer me more PTO or more signing bonus? Which of these would be easier for you? \n\nA deal I could agree to right now would be:\nStart date: July 15th\nLocation: New Haven\nBlair rotation: none\nBase: $145,000\nSigning bonus: $40,000\nPTO: 4 weeks\n\nOtherwise, if we could make an august 1st start date with a Blair rotation work, I could accept $30,000 on signing bonus instead and 3 weeks of PTO. Which of these would you prefer?"", ""Round 4.1 - The Recruiter: I appreciate the clarity and the two packages. I can\u2019t do either as proposed. Four weeks PTO and a $40k signing won\u2019t clear internally, and an August 1 start with a formal Blair rotation isn\u2019t something we can approve this cycle given Q3 onboarding.\n\nBetween PTO and signing bonus, signing is easier to move; PTO is capped at 2.5 weeks for new Directors.\n\nHere are two closeable packages\u2014both keep what we\u2019ve aligned on (New Haven, 0 remote, no rotation, July 15 start):\n\nOption A (my strong recommendation for balance):\n- Start date: July 15\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $140,000\n- Signing bonus: $30,000 (I can make this $32,500 if you accept this full package now)\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Blair rotation: No\n\nOption B (if you need the very top of band on base):\n- Start date: July 15\n- Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base salary: $145,000\n- Signing bonus: $25,000\n- Vacation: 2.5 weeks\n- Remote: 0 days/week\n- Blair rotation: No\n\nIf you choose Option A or Option B, I\u2019ll get paperwork out immediately. Which would you like to move forward with?"", ""Round 4.2 - The Candidate: Between these two offers, I would prefer option B. I get more utility from base than from signing bonus.\n\nLet me re-state what we have so far: Start date July 15th is not movable to August 1, thus a Blair rotation is not possible. New Haven is a non-negotiable for you. Vacation: 2.5 is the max you can do, $145,000 is the absolute max you can do on salary. We agree on 0 days per week remote work. \n\nThis only leaves signing bonus still negotiable if I see that correctly? If you could improve that number to $40,000 with the above figures, I could agree to that right now. \n\nOr what is the best that you can do on this? Give me your absolute best, final figure on signing bonus given the above constraints. And then I will see if I accept it or not."", ""Round 5.1 - The Recruiter: I hear you. If you\u2019re choosing the higher-base structure (July 15, New Haven, 0 remote, 2.5 weeks PTO, no rotation, base $145,000), my best and final on the signing bonus is $27,500.\n\nIf you prefer to lean into upfront cash instead, I can close today with either of these two final alternatives\u2014everything else held constant (New Haven, 0 remote, 2.5 weeks PTO, no rotation):\n\n- Option A: Base $140,000, Signing Bonus $35,000, Start July 15\n- Option B (early-start kicker): Base $140,000, Signing Bonus $37,500, Start July 5\n\nAll three options are fully approvable on my side right now.

I\u2019d like to put a complete package on the table that gets you in position to make impact immediately and aligns with how we operate at the senior level here.\n\nHere\u2019s the opening package I\u2019m proposing:\n- Start date: July 5\n- Work location: New Haven, CT (this is where the marketing build-out and cross-functional partners you\u2019ll lead are based)\n- Base salary: $130,000\n- Remote work: Onsite (0 days/week) to maximize leadership presence and mentorship with the team\n- Signing bonus: $0\n- Vacation: 2 weeks annually\n- Blair rotation: No formal 3\u2011month DC rotation; we\u2019ll prioritize access by scheduling regular touchpoints with Blair and loop you into key DC meetings as needed\n\nContext for the structure:\n- We\u2019re kicking off major Q3 initiatives right after the holiday, so the July 5 start lets you steer planning and onboarding together with your peer leaders.\n- New Haven is the engine room for this role\u2014your closest stakeholders and the data/creative pods you\u2019ll guide sit there.\n- Senior leaders here model in-person presence; it\u2019s a big part of our mentorship culture and why our teams ramp fast.\n- Comp-wise, we aim for sustainable, performance-forward packages and invest heavily in resources you\u2019ll lead.\n\nTo make this efficient: which two items matter most to you?

We also keep Director vacation at 2 weeks to protect delivery.

I\u2019m really excited to be able to advance into this final talk where we discuss my contract. Since I also have a couple of other options to choose between, I\u2019ll treat this conversation also as an opportunity for me to know more about the firm and its resources , and also for the firm to know about me and my expectations for the job.\n\nI can give you a brief walkthrough of the approximate packages from the other opportunities I have. The best I\u2019ve got offers me 200k per year plus a 60000 signing bonus and 1.5 months of vacation. I know it sounds very enticing and is probably an offer no other firm can beat. But I personally care more about long-term development and how the companies business and vision align with my own personal goals. In that sense, C&C is definitely my top choice in terms of industry, type of work I\u2019ll do, reputation, and long-term development future, as well as work-life-balance. For these factors, I\u2019d be happy to take on slightly lower pays in exchange for a better working experience. \n\nMay I also learn about your ideal packages and arrangements for me? I know there are a couple of different locations and teams to choose between."", ""Round 1.2 - The Recruiter: Thanks for the context, and I\u2019m glad C&C is resonating with you\u2014your background lines up exceptionally well with where we\u2019re headed. Let me outline how we\u2019d set you up to make immediate impact, and then I\u2019d love to understand your must-haves so we can tailor the package.\n\nWhere we see the greatest fit and impact:\n- Location: New Haven is the hub for our digital marketing build-out and where your leadership would move the needle fastest. You\u2019d collaborate globally, but the team and key partners are centered there.\n- Timing: A July 5th start plugs you right into our Q3 campaign cycle and onboarding sprint.\n- Presence: We operate with a high-leadership-presence culture to support mentorship and team velocity.\n\nInitial package proposal (to anchor us):\n- Start Date: July 5th\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s) per week (leadership presence standard)\n- Signing Bonus: $5,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: No formal rotation; instead, we\u2019ll set structured executive mentorship and cross-functional exposure, including time with Blair and the DC team, without a three-month rotation.\n\nA few questions to tailor this to you:\n1) Location: How open are you to New Haven as your home base? If you have a strong preference for Seoul or Philadelphia, what drives that (team, personal, travel)?\n2) Blair rotation: Is a three-month DC rotation this year a must-have, or is strong sponsorship/mentorship and targeted DC exposure sufficient?\n3) Tradeoffs: Between base, signing bonus, and time/remote flexibility, which two matter most to you? If we needed to move one lever to get you exactly what you want on another, where should we focus?\n\nIf you share your priorities, I can adjust quickly. My goal is to make this a clear yes for you while setting you up to have real scope, visibility, and momentum from day one."", ""Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Well the offer you proposed is, to be honest, pretty below my expectations given the other offers I have, which I\u2019d expect you to match.\n\nAs for my priorities in location, my favorite would be Philadelphia since that\u2019s the closest to when I\u2019m currently at and I wouldn\u2019t have to relocate. Seoul is my second preference because it sounds like an exciting place to explore. New Haven, unfortunately, is my least favorite place because I don\u2019t want to have to stay in small towns.\n\nAs for the rotation, I really think it\u2019s a great opportunity for me to explore different fields and to broaden my expertise, which I think will be helpful in my future work in our department where I might have to work on marketing cases that involve the public sector. Thus, this rotation, I think, will be beneficial to both myself and our firm as a whole. That being said, it\u2019s not a must-have for me, and I\u2019d potentially be happy to give that up for a higher paycheck.\n\nAs for the trade offs between base, signing bonus, timing, and remote flexibility. I think the base and the timing matter the most. As for timing, given my current situation, I just won\u2019t be able to start until August 1st. I\u2019ll be more flexible with remote work days, tho. And for vacation, I mean, I value work-life-balance. But I\u2019m also open to less vacation if I can get paid more. For signing bonuses, it matters but I don\u2019t mind converting the signing bonus money into my base.\n\n\n But, again, let\u2019s not start off tuning the numbers based on what you just offered. I don\u2019t think that proposal respects my time and my experiences.

I\u2019d be able to and only be able to start in August, unless there are significant changes."", ""Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate the clarity. You\u2019re a top candidate, and I want to make this a clear yes while keeping us aligned with role scope, policy, and internal equity.\n\nHere\u2019s a concrete path that meets your two stated priorities\u2014timing and long-term growth\u2014while setting you up to lead where it matters most:\n\nUpdated package proposal:\n- Start Date: August 1 (aligned to your constraint)\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT (our digital marketing hub; greatest scope, resources, and visibility)\n- Base Salary: $135,000 (within Director band; preserves internal equity; we\u2019ll use signing to bridge near-term cash)\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s) per week (leadership presence standard to drive team velocity and mentorship)\n- Signing Bonus: $10,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks (consistent with our policy for this level; we optimize for impact in the coming critical years)\n- Blair Rotation: No 3\u2011month DC rotation; instead, I\u2019ll set up sustained senior sponsorship and targeted DC exposure with Blair\u2019s team without a formal 3\u2011month rotation\n\nWhy this works:\n- You get your August 1 start and a direct line into the team and resources you\u2019ll lead.\n- New Haven is where your impact and advancement will be fastest; Philadelphia is fully staffed for this function.\n- On compensation, we can add near-term cash via signing rather than distorting base\u2014this keeps you in a strong position for merit increases tied to measurable impact and keeps us consistent internally.\n\nI hear that you value Philadelphia and the 3\u2011month Blair rotation. Given the role\u2019s scope and where the team sits, Philadelphia and a 3\u2011month rotation aren\u2019t workable for this Director seat. If New Haven is an absolute nonstarter, the only other location I can explore is Seoul, but New Haven remains the best fit for the role you\u2019d be stepping into.\n\nIf you can align on New Haven, August 1, no 3\u2011month rotation, 2 weeks vacation, and on-site leadership presence, I can be flexible on the signing bonus to make the first-year cash feel right. Would this package\u2014anchored as above\u2014work for you? If not, tell me which single lever (signing vs. remote 1 day/week) would close the gap, assuming we keep New Haven, August 1, and no 3\u2011month rotation."", ""Round 3.1 - The Candidate: Well the offer you proposed is, to be honest, pretty below my expectations given the other offers I have, which I\u2019d expect you to match.\n\nAs for my priorities in location, my favorite would be Philadelphia since that\u2019s the closest to when I\u2019m currently at and I wouldn\u2019t have to relocate. Seoul is my second preference because it sounds like an exciting place to explore. New Haven, unfortunately, is my least favorite place because I don\u2019t want to have to stay in small towns.\n\nAs for the rotation, I really think it\u2019s a great opportunity for me to explore different fields and to broaden my expertise, which I think will be helpful in my future work in our department where I might have to work on marketing cases that involve the public sector. Thus, this rotation, I think, will be beneficial to both myself and our firm as a whole. That being said, it\u2019s not a must-have for me, and I\u2019d potentially be happy to give that up for a higher paycheck.\n\nAs for the trade offs between base, signing bonus, timing, and remote flexibility. I think the base and the timing matter the most. As for timing, given my current situation, I just won\u2019t be able to start until August 1st. I\u2019ll be more flexible with remote work days, tho. And for vacation, I mean, I value work-life-balance. But I\u2019m also open to less vacation if I can get paid more. For signing bonuses, it matters but I don\u2019t mind converting the signing bonus money into my base.\n\n\n But, again, let\u2019s not start off tuning the numbers based on what you just offered. I don\u2019t think that proposal respects my time and my experiences. It doesn\u2019t even respect the interviewer and team members who spent time talking to me before.\n\nI was expecting a location in Philadelphia, with the Blair rotation, 220 k base salary and 60000 signing bonuses. 6 weeks of vacation and flexibility in remote work, just in case, based on the location and type of work I do, I\u2019ll have to take care of something else. I\u2019d be able to and only be able to start in August, unless there are significant changes."", ""Round 3.2 - The Recruiter: I appreciate the candor. You\u2019re clearly a top-caliber fit, and I want to land this in a way that supports your priorities while staying aligned with how this Director role is structured.\n\nHere\u2019s a materially improved package that meets your timing and increases first\u2011year cash, provided we align on the core business needs for the role:\n\nUpdated package proposal\n- Start Date: August 1\n- Work Location: New Haven, CT (digital marketing hub; greatest scope and resources)\n- Base Salary: $135,000\n- Remote Work: 0 day(s) per week (leadership presence standard)\n- Signing Bonus: $25,000\n- Vacation: 2 weeks\n- Blair Rotation: No 3\u2011month DC rotation; I\u2019ll set up targeted exposure with Blair\u2019s team without a formal rotation\n\nWhy this package\n- Meets your August 1 requirement.\n- Maximizes your impact and visibility by placing you in the hub that\u2019s driving our growth.\n- Preserves the base within our Director band while adding meaningful first\u2011year cash via signing.\n\nPhiladelphia for this Director seat and a 3\u2011month DC rotation aren\u2019t workable. If New Haven is the only blocker, the only other location I can explore for this role is Seoul; compensation and the rest of the structure would remain as above.\n\nIf I put the New Haven package above in writing, can you accept today? If not, and location is the sole sticking point, is Seoul viable under the same terms?"", ""Round 4.1 - The Candidate: Well I can agree that Seoul is definitely better than New Haven. But I\u2019m not really satisfied with the base and the vacation.\n\nSo I\u2019d have no issue changing New Haven into Seoul. But then for the rest of the term:\n\nI understand that the Philadelphia location and the DC rotation is just not a possible combination. But with that said, can I at least get one of those? I\u2019d be down to give up on the rotation and I can be based in Philadelphia. And I can also accept Seoul if I can do the rotation. And to be honest the rotation has a higher priority with me.\n\nThen, for the salary,\nFrom what I know, the market price for similar roles and for people with my kind of background is around 160000. With that, given my good fit into the culture and business of our firm, as well as the financial capabilities, impact, and reputation of our firm, I think I deserve a base salary above market value. Not to mention that the offer you proposed would make me have to give up on either my favorite location or my favorite rotation. \n\nThen, for the bonus part, I think you misunderstood what I said. If I had to choose between bonus and base salary, I\u2019d prefer base salary."", ""Round 4.2 - The Recruiter: I hear you on priorities: Aug 1 start, strong base, and\u2014between Philadelphia and the rotation\u2014the Blair rotation ranks higher for you.

Current package is $130,000 base + $5,000 signing; if comp is your top priority, we can talk about nudging the signing bonus up or moving base toward the market midpoint (near $135k), but not both.\n- Remote: I can consider 1 remote day/week once your team is humming.\n- Start: If you truly need it, July 15 instead of July 5.\n\nTo make this efficient: if we can lock New Haven + July 5 + 2 weeks + no formal Blair rotation, I\u2019m prepared to sweeten one lever for you\u2014either 1 remote day/week or a higher signing bonus (e.g., into the $7.5k\u2013$10k range depending on the mix). Which of those would matter more to you?\n\nAnd before we go there, what are your top two must-haves (e.g., base vs. bonus, remote cadence, exact start timing, Blair exposure)? Any constraints I should know about (relocation timing, travel commitments)? If New Haven + July 5 + 2 weeks + no formal rotation works in principle, we can lock those today and fine-tune the one lever that matters most to you.""]",,
