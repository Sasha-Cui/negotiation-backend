      "- Work Location: New Haven, CT. This is where the team needs senior marketing leadership most right now.\n",
      "- Start Date: July 5th so you can be present for the CEO’s internal online conference and hit the ground running with the cross-functional leaders you’ll work with.\n",
      "- Base Salary: $135,000 (aligned with our internal equity bands for Directors).\n",
      "- Remote Work: 0 day(s) / week (we’re aligned here).\n",
      "- Signing Bonus: $10,000.\n",
      "- Vacation: 2 weeks PTO.\n",
      "- Blair Rotation: No formal 3‑month DC rotation. Instead, we’ll ensure structured exposure—regular strategy touchpoints with Blair and DC stakeholders as part of your remit without delaying start or reworking the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few notes:\n",
      "- Philadelphia is well-staffed; placing you in New Haven creates the biggest impact. We can incorporate regular collaboration with Philly as part of your scope.\n",
      "- The Blair rotation requires an August 1+ start and contract revisions; avoiding that lets you attend the July conference and build momentum immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can align on New Haven, July 5, and no formal rotation, we’re in great shape. Tell me which elements are most important to you, and if there’s a specific area you’d like me to prioritize (e.g., bonus vs. salary) we can look at modest movement there while keeping the core needs above intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Round 2.1 - The Candidate: Thank you for the offerings, I appreciate the transparency and the thought behind the business needs. I’m genuinely excited about joining, and I want to make sure we structure this in a way that sets both the team and me up for long-term success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the areas that are most important for me to align on, along with the reasoning behind them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Work Location: Seoul, South Korea\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand the rationale around New Haven, and it’s helpful context. That said, based on what Blair and others mentioned about global market expansion, Seoul seems to be where the team is least staffed and where senior marketing leadership could have the biggest strategic impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the goal is to “place leadership where it moves the needle most,” Seoul aligns strongly with that direction. I’m excited about the idea of being embedded there and helping build out a stronger presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Base Salary: Targeting $175,000 or above\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand the internal equity banding, but external benchmarks for Director-level online marketing roles in biotech/digital health in major markets are coming in higher. Most competitive offers I’ve seen fall in the $155k–$170k+ range, and given the scope of the role you’ve described - cross-functional leadership, conference prep, and international alignment — a salary in the $175,000 range feels appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "If helpful, I’m open to discussing structure (e.g., partial salary + increased bonus) to land in the right place.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Start Date: August 1\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior commitments already in place:\n",
      "I have longstanding personal and travel commitments in June and July — including my annual participation in the World Series of Poker Tournament — that I’m not able to adjust. These commitments have been on the calendar for many months, and honoring them is important for maintaining the balance that keeps me performing well professionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alignment with the development path we discussed:\n",
      "Much of our conversation throughout the interview process touched on the value of early exposure to Government Affairs and the meaningful career development opportunity of a structured rotation with Blair’s team. An August 1 start aligns with the timing requirements of that rotation and provides a structured, purposeful foundation for the Director role rather than rushing onboarding to meet the July conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minimal downside to the business:\n",
      "I will still be fully prepared to integrate with cross-functional leaders and hit the ground running — in fact, starting with proper preparation, full focus, and alignment with the rotation program will position me to contribute more effectively in my first quarter. The team gains more from a well-set-up start than from squeezing onboarding into early July.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Blair Rotation — Important for Role Effectiveness\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand the desire to streamline onboarding and avoid contract revisions, and I appreciate the offer of structured touchpoints with Blair. That said, the formal 3-month rotation is a key priority for me, and I believe it creates meaningful upside for the company as well:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Direct exposure accelerates my ability to deliver cross-functionally\n",
      "Much of the Director role requires coordination with Government Affairs and policy-driven initiatives. A structured rotation — even if reduced in length — would allow me to build the relationships, context, and strategic understanding needed to operate effectively across teams. The “light-touch” alternative doesn’t provide the same depth or acceleration.\n",
      "\n",
      "• This rotation was a recurring theme throughout interviews\n",
      "Multiple conversations emphasized how valuable this immersion would be for understanding the company’s policy landscape and long-term strategy. Preserving this component creates continuity with the pathway we discussed and strengthens the foundation for my role.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Aligns with the company’s leadership development model\n",
      "You mentioned wanting Directors to be fully integrated into cross-functional work early. The rotation directly supports that by giving me structured time with the team that shapes many of the constraints and opportunities marketing must respond to.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Logistically, the rotation aligns naturally with an August 1 start\n",
      "If an August 1 date is acceptable, the rotation can proceed without conflicting with the July conference or disrupting onboarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. PTO: At least 3 weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the level of responsibility and expected bandwidth, a minimum of 3 weeks feels aligned with industry norms for Director roles. I’m flexible on how it’s structured (e.g., front-loaded vs. accrual), but 2 weeks wouldn’t be sustainable long-term.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Round 2.2 - The Recruiter: Appreciate the thoughtful context—here’s a path that gets you set up for impact while aligning to our business needs and internal equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core proposal (ready to finalize):\n",
      "- Work Location: New Haven, CT (biggest immediate need and leverage for your leadership)\n",
      "- Start Date: July 5th (preferred so you’re plugged into the CEO’s internal online conference)\n",
      "- Base Salary: $135,000 (aligned to Director band and internal equity)\n",
      "- Remote Work: 0 day(s) / week\n",
      "- Signing Bonus: $20,000\n",
      "- Vacation: 2.5 weeks PTO\n",
      "- Blair Rotation: No formal 3‑month rotation; instead, we’ll set a structured immersion with Blair and DC stakeholders (weekly touchpoints, defined workstreams, and an early on‑site block) without delaying start or revising the contract\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this works:\n",
      "- It places you where your leadership will drive the most lift right now.\n",
      "- Preserves momentum with July conference integration.\n",
      "- Provides meaningful upfront cash via the sign-on while keeping base consistent with equity.\n",
      "- Gives you more PTO than standard while maintaining team cadence.\n",
      "- Ensures deep exposure to Blair’s world without a contract rewrite or August 1 constraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flexibility:\n",
      "- If July 5 is truly unworkable, I can flex to July 15 on this same package (no rotation). August 1 with a formal rotation isn’t feasible on our side.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Seoul:\n",
      "- I hear your interest. From day one, we’ll scope regular Seoul collaboration and travel so you can shape the global motion while leading from New Haven. If you drive the impact we expect, we can revisit medium‑term placement once the New Haven lift is achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can align on the package above (New Haven, July 5 or July 15, no formal rotation), I can get approvals and we can wrap this today.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Round 3.1 - The Candidate: Thank you for sharing the updated package. I’d like to share a few points where alignment is particularly important for me, and propose ways we could structure the package to benefit both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Start Date: August 1\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that a formal Blair rotation isn’t feasible if I start on August 1, and that’s fine. My priority is to begin August 1, which allows me to come in fully prepared, both logistically and strategically, and maximize impact from day one. Starting at this date ensures I can hit the ground running with cross-functional teams, integrate effectively into the business, and deliver results from the outset.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Base Salary\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand the internal equity bands, but market benchmarks for Director-level online marketing roles in similar industries are above $150,000. Given the scope and expectations for this role, a base in the $175,000 range is appropriate. I’m happy to explore a structure that balances salary and bonus to arrive at a mutually agreeable total package.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. PTO and Signing Bonus\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m flexible on the balance here. For example, I’m happy to accept 2 weeks PTO if we can structure the signing bonus closer to $40,000, reflecting both the immediate contributions I’ll be making and the strategic lift the team needs from senior leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Round 3.2 - The Recruiter: I hear you on August 1 and appreciate the flexibility on rotation. To make August 1 work on our end while setting you up for impact, here’s a package I can get approved today:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n",
      "- Start Date: August 1st\n",
      "- Base Salary: $135,000\n",
      "- Remote Work: 0 day(s) / week\n",
      "- Signing Bonus: $30,000\n",
      "- Vacation: 2 weeks\n",
      "- Blair Rotation: No formal rotation (we’ll set structured, recurring touchpoints with Blair and DC stakeholders)\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this works:\n",
      "- It locks in New Haven where your leadership moves the needle immediately.\n",
      "- It honors your August 1 timing while increasing the sign-on.\n",
      "- It keeps base aligned with internal equity and preserves our in-office leadership model.\n",
      "- It gives you the runway to integrate deeply with DC via structured touchpoints without delaying start.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Seoul: you’ll have immediate exposure and ownership over global initiatives from New Haven, with planned travel and collaboration with the Seoul team built into your remit.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can align on this package, I’ll route it for final approval and get the paperwork out today.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Round 4.1 - The Candidate: Thank you for updating the package and for the flexibility on the August 1 start. I’m very excited about the opportunity and the chance to contribute as Director of Online Marketing. I’d like to share a few thoughts regarding compensation and location to ensure the final package reflects the scope and expectations of the role.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Base Salary and Signing Bonus\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed base of $135,000 is below market for Director-level online marketing roles in similar industries and geographies. Additionally, this role requires 100% onsite presence, which demands a higher level of commitment and flexibility. Given the scope, responsibility, and the onsite expectation, it makes sense for the base salary to be competitive with market benchmarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate the increase in the signing bonus to $30,000. To bridge the gap to market competitiveness, I’d like to explore a higher bonus or additional PTO, or a combination that fairly reflects the responsibilities, expected impact, and the onsite nature of the role.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Work Location\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand New Haven is the current priority for senior marketing leadership. While it’s not my preferred location, I’m open to making it work if the total compensation is adjusted to account for relocation and commuting costs. This would make the transition feasible and ensure I can contribute fully from day one.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the location can be adjusted to Philadelphia, I’m comfortable with the proposed base and bonus structure, as this aligns well with my personal and logistical preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Round 4.2 - The Recruiter: I really appreciate your flexibility and the thoughtful way you’re approaching this. To make this work for both of us, here’s a clear path that addresses your compensation ask while keeping the core business needs intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-negotiables to keep us aligned:\n",
      "- Work Location: New Haven, CT (this is essential for the team’s needs)\n",
      "- Base Salary: $135,000 (must remain aligned to internal equity)\n",
      "- Remote: 0 day(s) / week\n",
      "- Blair Rotation: No formal rotation\n",
      "\n",
      "I can move on immediate cash to reflect the onsite commitment and transition:\n",
      "\n",
      "Option A (preferred for us):\n",
      "- Start Date: July 15\n",
      "- Signing Bonus: $35,000\n",
      "- Vacation: 2 weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "Option B (if August 1 is immovable):\n",
      "- Start Date: August 1\n",
      "- Signing Bonus: $32,500\n",
      "- Vacation: 2 weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can do July 5, I can stretch to:\n",
      "- Start Date: July 5\n",
      "- Signing Bonus: $37,500\n",
      "- Vacation: 2 weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "Philadelphia isn’t feasible given staffing and priorities. If you want to lock this today, choose A or B (or July 5 if somehow workable) and I’ll route immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Round 5.1 - The Candidate: Thank you for the updated package. I really appreciate you reflecting the onsite commitment and transition. I understand the non-negotiable aspects. On my side, the start date Aug 1 is non-negotiable so I’m happy to accept Option B with one adjustment to maximize alignment:\n",
      "\n",
      "Vacation: Increase from 2 weeks → 3 weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "Signing Bonus: Adjust from $32,500 → $30,000 to account for the additional PTO\n",
      "\n",
      "This ensures I start fully energized and balances total points between bonus and vacation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m ready to finalize once we agree on this adjustment.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Round 5.2 - The Recruiter: I really appreciate the clarity and your willingness to balance the package.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can lock this in with your August 1 start and keep everything else aligned to the business needs. Here’s the final package I can approve today:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Work Location: New Haven, CT\n",
      "- Start Date: August 1st\n",
      "- Base Salary: $135,000\n",
      "- Remote Work: 0 day(s) / week\n",
      "- Signing Bonus: $30,000\n",
      "- Vacation: 2 weeks\n",
      "- Blair Rotation: No formal rotation (we’ll set recurring touchpoints with Blair and DC stakeholders)\n",
      "\n",
      "On PTO: for Directors, 2 weeks in year one is our standard to protect delivery cycles as you onboard and lead a critical team. We can revisit PTO at the annual review, with a path to increase based on performance and team cadence.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this works, I’ll route for immediate approval and get the paperwork to you today.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Round 6.1 - The Candidate: I think there may have been a misunderstanding regarding Option B. My intent was to proceed with Option B as originally discussed, with a signing bonus of $32,500.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d like to explore one possible adjustment to balance vacation and bonus:\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 1 (preferred): Vacation 3 weeks + Signing Bonus $30,000\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 2 (if not feasible): Vacation 2 weeks + Signing Bonus $32,500\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything else remains as outlined: New Haven, August 1 start, $135,000 base, 0 remote, no formal Blair rotation.\n",
